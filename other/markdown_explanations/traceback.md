Yes, you can definitely add traceback logging before raising exceptions! However, there are a few important considerations:

## Method 1: Add traceback logging before `raise`

```python
# Before:
raise ValueError('Run ID must be a valid UUID format')

# After:
import traceback
traceback.print_exc()  # This prints the current stack trace
raise ValueError('Run ID must be a valid UUID format')
```

**BUT IMPORTANT:** `traceback.print_exc()` only works if you're currently handling an exception. If you're not in an exception handler, it won't print anything useful.

## Method 2: Print current stack trace before raising

```python
# This works anywhere, even outside exception handlers:
import traceback
traceback.print_stack()  # Prints current call stack
raise ValueError('Run ID must be a valid UUID format')
```

## Method 3: Log the stack trace to your debug system

```python
import traceback

# Get the stack trace as a string
stack_trace = traceback.format_stack()
print__analysis_tracing_debug(f"STACK TRACE BEFORE RAISE: {''.join(stack_trace)}")
raise ValueError('Run ID must be a valid UUID format')
```

## Method 4: Include stack info in the exception message

```python
import traceback

# Include stack trace in the exception message itself
stack_info = ''.join(traceback.format_stack())
raise ValueError(f'Run ID must be a valid UUID format\nStack trace:\n{stack_info}')
```

## For your specific case

Since you want to debug where the f-string error is coming from, I'd recommend **Method 3** using your existing debug system:

```python
import traceback

# Before any raise statement where you want to see the call stack:
stack_trace = ''.join(traceback.format_stack())
print__analysis_tracing_debug(f"RAISING EXCEPTION - STACK TRACE: {stack_trace}")
raise ValueError('Run ID must be a valid UUID format')
```

This will show you exactly which code path led to the exception being raised, which should help you identify where the f-string with unescaped curly braces is located.

The key difference:
- `traceback.print_exc()` - shows the exception that's currently being handled
- `traceback.print_stack()` - shows the current call stack (where you are right now)
- `traceback.format_stack()` - returns the call stack as a string you can log

For debugging the f-string issue, you want `traceback.format_stack()` or `traceback.print_stack()`.
