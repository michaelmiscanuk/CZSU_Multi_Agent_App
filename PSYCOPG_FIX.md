# PostgreSQL Connection Pool Deprecation Warning Fix

## Problem
The application was showing this warning:
```
E:\OneDrive\Knowledge Base\0207_GenAI\Code\czsu_home\czsu-multi-agent-text-to-sql.venv\Lib\site-packages\psycopg_pool\pool_async.py:142: RuntimeWarning: opening the async pool AsyncConnectionPool in the constructor is deprecated and will not be supported anymore in a future release. Please use await pool.open(), or use the pool as context manager using: async with AsyncConnectionPool(...) as pool: ...
```

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `get_or_create_psycopg_pool()` function where we were creating `AsyncConnectionPool` without explicitly setting `open=False` and not using the modern context manager approach recommended by psycopg.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed the existing pool creation
In `postgres_checkpointer.py`, updated the `get_or_create_psycopg_pool()` function:

```python
# OLD (deprecated approach):
psycopg_pool_instance = psycopg_pool.AsyncConnectionPool(
    conninfo=connection_string,
    kwargs=connection_kwargs,
    min_size=2,
    max_size=10,
)

# NEW (fixed approach):
psycopg_pool_instance = psycopg_pool.AsyncConnectionPool(
    conninfo=connection_string,
    kwargs=connection_kwargs,
    min_size=2,
    max_size=10,
    open=False  # Explicitly set to False to avoid deprecation warning
)

# Open the pool explicitly using the modern approach
await psycopg_pool_instance.open()
```

### 2. Added modern context manager approach
Added a new function `modern_psycopg_pool()` that uses the recommended async context manager approach:

```python
@asynccontextmanager
async def modern_psycopg_pool():
    async with psycopg_pool.AsyncConnectionPool(
        conninfo=connection_string,
        kwargs=connection_kwargs,
        min_size=2,
        max_size=10,
        open=False  # Explicitly set to avoid warning
    ) as pool:
        yield pool
```

### 3. Enhanced cleanup
Added proper cleanup functions:
- `force_close_psycopg_pool()` - closes the psycopg pool specifically
- `cleanup_all_pools()` - cleans up all connection pools

## Usage

### Current approach (maintains backward compatibility):
```python
# Existing code continues to work
checkpointer_manager = await get_postgres_checkpointer()
async with checkpointer_manager as checkpointer:
    # Use checkpointer
    pass
```

### Modern approach (recommended for new code):
```python
async with modern_psycopg_pool() as pool:
    async with pool.connection() as conn:
        await conn.execute("SELECT 1")
```

## Testing
Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
python test_psycopg_fix.py
```

This will test both approaches and report any remaining warnings.

## Benefits
1. ✅ Eliminates deprecation warnings
2. ✅ Uses modern psycopg best practices
3. ✅ Maintains backward compatibility
4. ✅ Better resource management
5. ✅ Future-proof against psycopg updates
