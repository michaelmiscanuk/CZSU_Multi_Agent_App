Zemědělství (Agriculture) je klíčovým sektorem české ekonomiky, který zahrnuje různé činnosti spojené s pěstováním plodin a chovem zvířat. Tento sektor hraje důležitou roli v zajištění potravinové bezpečnosti a udržitelnosti země. V České republice se zemědělství vyznačuje rozmanitostí, od tradičního pěstování obilovin po moderní metody ekologického zemědělství.

Zemědělství také přispívá k ochraně krajiny a biodiverzity, a to prostřednictvím udržitelného hospodaření s půdou a vodními zdroji. V posledních letech se zvyšuje důraz na ekologické a udržitelné praktiky, které mají za cíl minimalizovat negativní dopady na životní prostředí.

Zemědělství
Agriculture
Metodické vysvětlivky
Do odvětví zemědělství jsou zařazeny podnikatelské subjekty zemědělské prvovýroby, jejichž činností je rostlinná a živočišná výroba a služby pro zemědělství podle Klasifikace ekonomických činností (CZ-NACE) oddíl 01. Údaje za myslivost (CZ-NACE, skupina 01.7) jsou vzhledem k užší návaznosti na lesní hospodářství uvedeny v kapitole 14 Lesnictví.

Základní evidenční jednotkou v zemědělské statistice je zemědělský subjekt vymezený alespoň jednou z uvedených prahových hodnot – výměra od 1 ha obhospodařované zemědělské půdy, 1500 m² pěstovaných intenzivních plodin (sady, zelenina, květiny), 1000 m² vinic, 300 m² skleníků a pařenišť, chov od 1 ks skotu, 2 ks prasat, 4 ks ovcí a koz, 50 ks drůbeže, 100 ks králíků.

Údaje jsou zjišťovány převážně výběrovým způsobem. Vybraný soubor respondentů vychází z aktualizovaného stavu Zemědělského registru a zjištěné výsledky jsou dopočítávány pomocí matematicko-statistických metod. Celoplošná strukturální šetření, podchycující veškeré hospodařící zemědělské subjekty, jsou zabezpečována v delších časových intervalech v rámci Agrocenzů. Od roku 2002 se údaje šetří a dopočítávají pouze za zemědělský sektor, nezahrnují domácnosti mimo zemědělský sektor.

Poznámky k tabulkám
Tab. 13-1 až 13-4 Souhrnný zemědělský účet
Souhrnný zemědělský účet (SZÚ) je základním metodologickým nástrojem pro měření ekonomické velikosti a výkonnosti zemědělské prvovýroby. Základní součástí SZÚ jsou tyto agregáty:
– produkce zemědělského odvětví, která představuje sumu zemědělských výrobků a zemědělských služeb vyprodukovaných příslušnými jednotkami tohoto odvětví a vedlejší neoddělitelné činnosti;
– mezispotřeba, která měří hodnotu vlastních výrobků, zboží a služeb spotřebovaných ve výrobním procesu (vyjma dlouhodobých aktiv, jejichž spotřeba se zachycuje jako spotřeba fixního kapitálu) a slouží jako jeden z hlavních indikátorů produkční intenzity odvětví zemědělství. Podle Nařízení Komise (ES) č. 909/2006, kterým se mění přílohy I a II nařízení Evropského parlamentu a Rady (ES) č. 138/2004 o souhrnném zemědělském účtu ve Společenství, je její součástí FISIM (finanční zprostředkovatelské služby nepřímo měřené);
– hrubá přidaná hodnota, která znázorňuje výsledný efekt odvětví zemědělství měřený rozdílem mezi produkcí zemědělského odvětví a mezispotřebou. Tento ukazatel slouží k hodnocení výkonnosti odvětví zemědělství;
– čistá přidaná hodnota představuje hodnotu, která je vytvořena veškerými zemědělskými jednotkami po odečtení spotřeby fixního kapitálu.

Ze souhrnného zemědělského účtu jsou vyloučeny jednotky produkující pouze pro vlastní spotřebu (zahrádky a chov hospodářských zvířat u domácností). Zemědělská produkce pro vlastní spotřebu rolníků, jejichž hospodářství překročí spodní prahovou hodnotu, je však v SZÚ zahrnuta.

Produkce se oceňuje v základní ceně, tj. částkou, kterou výrobce obdrží od kupujícího za jednotku jím vyprodukovaného zboží a služeb, mínus daně na produkty plus dotace na produkty. Mezispotřeba se oceňuje v pořizovacích cenách za zboží nebo služby, které jsou platné v okamžiku, kdy vstupují do výrobního procesu. Tato cena zahrnuje daně na produkty mínus dotace na produkty, s výjimkou DPH.

Tab. 13-5 Obhospodařovaná zemědělská půda a osevní plochy zemědělských plodin
Obhospodařovaná zemědělská půda a osevní plochy zemědělských plodin se zjišťují šetřením k 31. květnu referenčního roku. Obhospodařovaná zemědělská půda je pravidelně obhospodařovaná půda využívaná pro pěstování zemědělských plodin.

Methodological notes
The agricultural “industry” comprises agricultural primary production enterprises engaged in crop production, animal production, and providing services for agriculture, according to the Classification of Economic Activities (CZ-NACE), division 01. Data on gamekeeping covering economic activities given in the CZ-NACE 01.7 group are provided in Chapter 14 Forestry because they have a closer relation to forest management.

The basic unit in agricultural statistics is an agricultural holding defined by at least one of the thresholds as follows: having utilised agricultural area of 1 hectare and more, 1 500 m² of grown intensive crops (orchards, vegetables, flowers), 1 000 m² of vineyards, 300 m² of greenhouses and/or hotbeds, farming of livestock from 1 head of cattle, or 2 head of pigs, or 4 head of sheep or goats, or 50 head of poultry, or 100 head of rabbits.

Data are mostly obtained by sample surveys. The sample of selected respondents is based on the updated Farm Register and the results acquired are grossed up by means of mathematical and statistical methods. Nation-wide structural surveys, which cover all active agricultural entities, are conducted at longer time intervals within agricultural censuses. Since 2002, all data have been measured and grossed up for the agricultural sector only and do not include households of the population out of the agricultural sector.

Notes on Tables
Tables 13-1 to 13-4 Economic accounts for agriculture
The economic accounts for agriculture (EAA) are a fundamental methodological instrument to measure the economic size and performance of agricultural primary production. They include the following aggregates:
– output of the agricultural “industry” is the sum of agricultural products and agricultural services produced by holdings operating in the agricultural “industry” and their inseparable non-agricultural secondary activities;
– intermediate consumption measures the value of own products, goods, and services consumed in the production process (excluding long-term assets, consumption of which is captured as the fixed capital consumption) and serves as one of the key indicators of the production intensity of agriculture. According to the Commission Regulation (EC) No 909/2006 amending Annexes I and II to Regulation (EC) No 138/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the economic accounts for agriculture in the Community this consumption shall include FISIM (financial intermediation services indirectly measured);
– gross value added indicates the resulting effect of the agricultural “industry” measured as the difference between the agricultural “industry” output and intermediate consumption. It is used to assess the performance of the agricultural “industry”;
– net value added is the value produced by all agricultural units, obtained by subtracting fixed capital consumption from the gross value added.

The economic accounts for agriculture exclude units producing solely for one’s own consumption (kitchen gardens and private livestock raising in households). However, they include the agricultural output for own consumption of farmers whose holdings are larger than the bottom threshold (holding size).

The output is valued at basic prices, i.e. by the amount the producer receives from the buyer for a unit of goods or services produced by the producer, minus taxes on products plus subsidies on products. The intermediate consumption is valued at acquisition prices of goods or services that are valid in the moment the goods and/or services are entering the production process. The price includes taxes on products minus subsidies on products, except for VAT.

Table 13-5 Utilised agricultural area and sown areas
The utilised agricultural area and sown area are measured by a survey as at 31 May of the reference year. The utilised agricultural area shall mean land under regular management used for cultivation of crops. It includes arable land, hop gardens, vineyards, gardens, orchards, permanent grassland, and other permanent crops. The sown area involves area of agricultural land sown or planted in spring of the given year, in the case of winter crops the area sown in autumn of the previous year, and areas sown in previous years in the case of multiannual crops grown on arable land.

Tables 13-6 to 13-9 Per hectare crop yields and harvests of crops
The per hectare yield is the ratio of the harvest to the harvested area of a crop. The harvest represents the total production of a crop of the standard humidity content and purity. Before 2016, the total harvest of arable fodder crops is given as hay and is composed of the harvest of perennial fodder crops as hay and the harvest of annual fodder crops as green fodder.

Zemědělství
Agriculture
Since 2017, the fodder crops harvest has been given with determined humidity content, which is 65% for green and silage maize, 83% for other annual fodder crops, and 15% for multiannual fodder crops. The total arable fodder crops harvest is given with humidity content of 15%. The harvested area is equal to the sown area, except for grain maize, green and silage maize, early potatoes, other potatoes, and permanent grasslands.

Table 13-13 Fruit trees and bushes, harvest of fruit
The number of fruit trees and bushes includes fruit trees and bushes dedicated to the fruit production of all age categories.

Table 13-15 Production of selected products in households
The table gives an overview of agricultural production in households outside the agricultural sector. The data are an informed guess based on results found on kitchen gardens of the household budget survey, survey on agricultural production in households, and annual data from the surveys on harvests and animal production.

Tables 13-16 to 13-20 Livestock and livestock density
Before 2023, the livestock population was given as at 1 April of the reference year. As of 2023, it is given as at 31 December of the reference year. Before 2023, poultry included chickens (Gallus gallus domestica), geese, ducks, and turkeys regardless of their utility type and category. As of 2023, it includes chickens (Gallus gallus domestica), geese, ducks, turkeys, other poultry, and ostriches regardless of their utility type and category. The livestock unit (LSU) is a reference unit which facilitates the aggregation of livestock from various species and age as per convention, via the use of specific coefficients established as follows: 0.4 for a bovine animal up to 1 year of age, 1.2 for a fattened bovine animal aged 1 year and over, 1.0 for other bovine animals aged 1 year and over, 0.3 for a sow, 0.2 for other pigs, 0.14 for a sheep animal, 0.1 for a goat, 1.0 for a horse, and 0.004 for a head of poultry.

Table 13-21 Animal production
The production of livestock for slaughter (cattle, pigs) and poultry includes the quantity of livestock in live weight, which were taken to the market for slaughtering and also livestock, which were slaughtered at own slaughterhouses (abattoirs), at other party slaughterhouses for wage, or slaughtered out of any abattoir. The market fish production means the amount of fish caught in lakes and special fish breeding facilities. It does not include fish caught in angling. The milk production includes the amount of milk both milked for sale and milk sucked by suckling calves of dairy cows; the amount of milk sucked from cows for meat, which are not milked for the milk production, is not counted in.

Table 13-22 Livestock yields
The number of heads reared (calves and piglets) is the number of animals, which reached a certain age limit (calves three months of age, piglets of the age of weaning). It is given related to the average population of cows or sows. The average annual milk yield is the quantity of milk produced per a dairy cow and year. The average annual egg yield is the number of eggs laid per one laying hen and year. The laying hen shall mean a hen, which has attained maturity for laying eggs and is bred for the production of eggs not intended for hatching.

Tables 13-23 and 13-24 Meat production and the average live weight of livestock for slaughter
The meat production gives the carcass weight of livestock slaughtered in registered slaughterhouses (abattoirs). It includes meat recognised as suitable for human consumption. The carcass weight refers to the weight of carcasses. Veal shall mean meat from cattle slaughtered at the age up to eight months and lamb shall mean meat from sheep slaughtered at the age up to one year. Poultry includes meat of slaughtered chicken, hens, ducks, geese, turkeys, and other domestic fowl bred for meat, but not for hunting purposes. The live weight is the weight of livestock for slaughter before the slaughter. The average live weight of pigs does not include sows and boars.

Table 13-28 Per capita consumption of selected kinds of food
Data on the agricultural and industrial production, self-supply, initial and final stocks, and on imports and exports are used for the calculation. These data are obtained from statistical surveys of the CZSO, from unions of food producers, and from other institutions. Food consumption is calculated using the mid-year population.

Tables 13-29 and 13-30 Consumption of fertilisers
Mineral fertilisers contain the declared nutrients in the form of minerals. Consumption of main nutrients is given as follows: nitrogen (N), phosphorus pentoxide (P₂O₅), and potassium oxide (K₂O). Nitrogenous fertilisers give the amount of nitrogen (N) in the mineral fertilisers consumed. Phosphatic fertilisers give the amount of phosphorus pentoxide (P₂O₅) in the mineral fertilisers consumed. Potassic fertilisers give the amount of potassium oxide (K₂O) in the mineral fertilisers consumed. Calcareous fertilisers give the consumption of calcareous matter in liming of agricultural land. Livestock manure is a by-product of livestock farming. It includes farmyard manure, slurry, liquid manure, and other types of livestock manure. It does not include by-products or main products from cultivation of crops, as collectable after-harvest remnants of plants (e.g. straw or beet greens) or crops for green manure. Organic fertilisers contain the declared nutrients in an organic form (e.g. compost, digestate). Organo-mineral fertilisers contain the declared nutrients in mineral and organic forms (e.g. enriched molasses stillage). The fertiliser consumption refers to consumption of reporting units of the sample (with no grossing up to the agricultural sector as a whole, i.e. it does not include small farmers) per hectare of utilised agricultural area as reported by them. The marketing year is the period from 1 July of the previous year to 30 June of the current year.

V obecnějším třídění spadají pod soukromé lesy.

Tab. 14-3 Kategorizace lesů
Do lesů hospodářských patří pozemky s lesními porosty, jejichž převažující funkcí je produkce dřeva. Do lesů ochranných se zařazují lesy na mimořádně nepříznivých stanovištích (např. sutě, prudké svahy, strže, rašeliniště, výsypky), dále vysokohorské lesy pod hranicí stromové vegetace chránící níže položené lesy, lesy na exponovaných hřebenech a lesy v klečovém lesním vegetačním stupni. Lesy zvláštního určení slouží k jiným účelům než je produkce dřeva. Patří sem lesy národních parků a národních přírodních rezervací, lesy v pásmech hygienické ochrany vodních zdrojů I. stupně a v ochranných pásmech zdrojů přírodních léčivých a stolních minerálních vod. Patří sem i lesy lázeňské, lesy příměstské (rekreační), lesy lesnických výzkumných ústavů a škol, lesy se zvýšenou funkcí půdoochrannou, vodoochrannou, klimatickou nebo krajinotvornou, lesy v uznaných oborách a bažantnicích a lesy potřebné pro zachování biologické různorodosti.

Tab. 14-4 až 14-6 a 14-8 Plochy dřevin, zalesňování podle druhů dřevin a spotřeba sazenic, bilance holin
Zalesňováním se rozumí zalesnění a obnova lesa provedené uměle – síjí a sadbou (tj. výsev a výsadba lesa, bez plochy přirozené obnovy lesa). Patří sem plochy poprvé i opakovaně zalesněné, vylepšování lesních kultur a doplňování náletů (přepočtené na plochu plného zalesnění). Od roku 2002 včetně obnovy pod porostem (podsadba a podsíje).

Probírky jsou výchovné zásahy v předmýtních lesních porostech (navazují na prořezávky – pročistky), které slouží k usměrnění vlastností porostu po stránce produkční, zajištění odolnosti a stability porostu. Patří sem zejména úpravy porostní skladby, tvarová výchova porostu a zpevnění porostu. Probírka se uskutečňuje odstraněním porostní složky hospodářsky nevhodné a nežádoucí ve prospěch porostní složky nadějné.

Methodological notes
Forestry encompasses all entities activities of which consist in afforestation/reforestation and forest regeneration, forest cultivation, felling, and other forestry activities. Figures on forestry are reported on the CZSO annual questionnaires (forms/reports) completed and submitted by businesses with 20+ employees and having forestry and logging as their principal activity, as classified in the division 02 of the Classification of Economic Activities (CZ-NACE), and by businesses, which manage forest land with the area of 200 hectares and larger.

The chapter also includes data on gamekeeping and hunting that is activities classified in the group 01.7 – Hunting, trapping and related service activities of the CZ-NACE.

Notes on Tables
Table 14-1 Basic indicators of enterprises in forestry and logging
Enterprises with the principal activity of forestry and logging (section 02 of the Classification of Economic Activities (CZ-NACE)) are included. For explanation of the indicators see methodological notes in the Chapter 18 Trade.

Table 14-2 Forest ownership
For presentation purposes, forest ownership in the Statistical Yearbook is broken down by type of forest management enterprises. State forests include forests owned by state-owned enterprises and organisations such as, for instance, Lesy České republiky, s. p. (Forests of the Czech Republic, state-owned enterprise), Vojenské lesy a statky ČR, s. p. (Army Forests and Farms of the Czech Republic, state-owned enterprise), national parks, and forest management enterprises of schools (universities). Municipal forests include all forests owned by municipalities irrespective of the method of their management. Private forests include forests owned by natural persons and forest companies. Other forests include forests owned by forest cooperatives, associations of individual forest owners, foreign and international enterprises and companies, churches, associations, foundations, etc. These forests make a part of private forests in a more generic classification.

Table 14-3 Forest categories
Production forests include land with forest stands the prevailing function of which is to produce wood. Protection forests include forests on extraordinarily adverse sites (such as screes, steep slopes, ravines, peatlands, and spoil banks), and furthermore high-altitude forests below the tree vegetation line, which protect forests at lower altitudes, forests on exposed ridges, and forests growing in the dwarf-pine forest vegetation zone. Special purpose forests serve for other purposes than the wood production. They include forests in national parks and national nature reserves and forests growing in level I water protection zones and water protection zones of natural curative and table mineral waters. They also include spa forests, suburban (recreational) forests, forests belonging to forest research institutes and forestry schools, forests with increased importance (function) for soil protection, water protection, climate forming, and landscaping, forests in recognised game preserves and pheasantries, and forests needed to preserve biological diversity.

Tables 14-4 to 14-6 and 14-8 Areas of tree species, afforestation/reforestation by tree species, consumption of plants, and balance of unstocked forest areas
Afforestation/reforestation refers to areas artificially afforested and/or reforested (including established plantations) by sowing and planting (that means sowing and planting excluding the area of natural regeneration of forest). It includes areas afforested for the first time as well as repeatedly afforested ones, areas of improved forest cultures and areas of forests from natural seeding supplemented with forest plantations (all converted into the total area of a new forest). Since 2002, it has been including regeneration under the stand (underplanting and undersowing).

Table 14-7 Technical forestry indicators
The forest nursery is a land dedicated to production of the planting stock of forest tree species. The soil reclamation of forest land includes all works to improve the soil production capacity, especially works ensuring the optimum water regime in soil. Common works include irrigation and drainage, for example. Game damage (evaluation of damage caused by game) represents the total amount of compensations, which the forest owners received from hunting grounds lessees for damage caused by game or, as the case may be, assessment of damage caused by game included in costs of one’s own hunting grounds.

Tables 14-9 and 14-10 Roundwood removals and deliveries. Roundwood removals include logged timber as volume of large timber and a portion of small-diameter timber (felling residues are not included), including logged timber in the so-called self-production felling. Large timber is wood mass of above-ground parts of the tree in diameter larger than 7 cm over bark. The volume is counted as timber from felling or silvicultural measures, including salvage felling.

Salvage felling includes data on all salvage felling measures and calamities of all kinds (of abiotic and biotic reasons). The overall range also includes standing dead trees (snags), isolated fallen trees (wind breaks), trees uprooted by windthrows, all volume of trap trees felled for the purpose of trapping bark beetles, and tree specimens, in which harmful insects (bark beetles and the like) overwinter. Volume processed in a given year is figured in.

Self-production shall mean the roundwood removals when timber obtained is left to the entity carrying out the felling for a fixed charge or free of charge. Self-production supplies the population with, first of all, fuelwood and is practised in compliance with regulations and instructions on permitting of such removals.

Roundwood deliveries include the volume of logged large timber and a portion of small-diameter timber delivered to domestic and foreign customers and for own consumption, irrespective of the place of delivery (felling residues and forest chips are not included). Large timber is wood mass of above-ground parts of the tree in diameter larger than 7 cm over bark.

Sawlogs and veneer logs involve resonance logs, veneer logs, and other special logs, sawlogs, poles, as well as mining timber, pit props, and pole timber. Pulpwood and other industrial roundwood include pulpwood – timber for production of (wood) pulp and wood-based panels, and roundwood for the production of groundwood (pulp for paper production).

Table 14-11 Selected forestry indicators by Region. Cleaning is tending of young stands especially to reduce the stand density and to optimise health and quality conditions of the stand. The total area, in hectares, of cleanings, clean-outs, pruning, and weeding (cleanings) is counted in, including the riparian stand cleanings.

Thinning shall mean tending of premature forest stands (as follow-ups to cleanings) to optimise stand properties in terms of wood production, resistance, and stability. This includes especially stand composition management, stand shape forming, and stand stabilisation. Thinning is carried out by removing of economically unsuitable and undesirable components of the stand in favour of the hopeful one.

Průmysl je klíčovým sektorem ekonomiky, který zahrnuje podniky s hlavní (převažující) průmyslovou činností. Tato činnost je podle Klasifikace ekonomických činností (CZ-NACE) zahrnuta do sekcí B – Těžba a dobývání, C – Zpracovatelský průmysl, D – Výroba a rozvod elektřiny, plynu, tepla a klimatizovaného vzduchu nebo E – Zásobování vodou; činnosti související s odpadními vodami, odpady a sanacemi. Podrobnější členění CZ-NACE zahrnuje 34 oddílů. Pokud výslovně není uvedeno jinak, veškeré výsledky uvedené v této kapitole reprezentují celou populaci průmyslových podniků bez ohledu na jejich velikost.

Poznámky k tabulkám uvádějí, že index průmyslové produkce měří vlastní výstup průmyslových odvětví i průmyslu celkem očištěný od cenových vlivů. Tento index je základním ukazatelem konjunkturální statistiky průmyslu. Při jeho výpočtu se z větší části vychází z tržeb za vlastní výrobky a služby přeceněné do stálých cen. Index je primárně počítán jako měsíční bazický index k průměrnému měsíci základního období, kterým je v současné době rok 2021.

Dále se uvádí, že spolu s publikováním výsledků za leden 2024 došlo ke změně bazického období u krátkodobých statistik. Indexy jsou nově poměřovány k průměru roku 2021, přičemž byla použita nová váhová schémata odvozená z výsledků strukturální podnikové statistiky za rok 2021. Pro přepočet do stálých cen byly použity nové cenové indexy.

Údaje v tabulce 15-6 jsou čerpány ze zpracování čtvrtletních statistických výkazů statistiky trhu práce. Tyto výsledky je třeba považovat za předběžné, neboť vycházejí ze šetření s omezenou velikostí výběrových souborů a s vyšším podílem odhadů. Naproti tomu tabulky 15-3 a 15-4 obsahují údaje ze zpracování ročních statistických výkazů poskytujících detailnější okruh definitivních dat, které jsou ale k dispozici s větším časovým zpožděním.

Se zveřejněním údajů za rok 2022 byly zároveň revidovány údaje za rok 2021. Revize se primárně týká dvou oblastí: zpřesnění ukazatelů statistiky práce a mezd s dopadem na všechna sledovaná odvětví a revize části finančních ukazatelů s dopadem výlučně na sekci D klasifikace NACE.

V důsledku provedených revizí nejsou údaje za dotčené ukazatele a odvětví za roky 2021 a 2022 plně srovnatelné s údaji publikovanými v časové řadě do roku 2020. Zpřesnění odhadu ukazatelů statistiky práce a mezd bylo možné díky širšímu využití dostupných administrativních dat z České správy sociálního zabezpečení a Generálního finančního ředitelství.

Revize v této oblasti se nejvýrazněji projevila v kategorii mikro a malých ekonomických subjektů a ovlivnila následující ukazatele: Průměrný evidenční počet zaměstnanců, Průměrný evidenční počet zaměstnanců přepočtený, Zaměstnané osoby, Mzdy bez ostatních osobních nákladů (OON), OON, Průměrná hrubá měsíční mzda na zaměstnance v evidenčním počtu, Průměrná hrubá měsíční mzda na přepočtené zaměstnance a Odpracované hodiny zaměstnanci.

Revize finančních ukazatelů v sekci D klasifikace NACE souvisí s dodatečnou úpravou vstupních dat v odvětví výroby elektřiny. Revize spočívá v úpravě způsobu zachycení termínových komoditních kontraktů s dopadem na rozdělení výnosů a nákladů mezi provozní a finanční část Výkazu zisku a ztráty.

Průměrný evidenční počet zaměstnanců přepočtený zahrnuje počet osob v pracovním, služebním nebo členském poměru k zaměstnavateli. Mzdy bez ostatních osobních nákladů zahrnují všechna peněžitá plnění, která byly zúčtovány zaměstnancům v evidenčním počtu podle příslušných platových a mzdových předpisů.

Tržby z prodeje výrobků a služeb představují tržby z prodeje vlastní hmotné a nehmotné produkce externím odběratelům.

Průmysl (Industry)
Tržby za prodej zboží představují tržby za prodej obchodního zboží, tj. produktů nakoupených za účelem dalšího prodeje v nezměněném stavu.
Výkony včetně obchodní marže zahrnují tržby z prodeje výrobků a služeb, obchodní marži (rozdíl mezi tržbami za prodané zboží a náklady na prodané zboží), změnu stavu zásob vlastní činnosti a aktivaci materiálu, zboží, služeb a dlouhodobého majetku.
Spotřeba materiálu a energie a náklady na služby – spotřebované nákupy (hodnota spotřebovaného materiálu a energií) a náklady na služby (externí služby, náklady na reprezentaci a drobný nehmotný majetek, o kterém účetní jednotka rozhodla, že není dlouhodobým majetkem). Do roku 2015 tomuto ukazateli obsahově odpovídal ukazatel „Výkonová spotřeba“.
Přidaná hodnota je rozdíl mezi výkony, včetně obchodní marže, a spotřebou materiálu a energie a nákladů na služby.
Výsledek hospodaření představuje rozdíl mezi výnosy celkem a náklady celkem za sledované období. Nabývá buď podoby zisku (kladný výsledek hospodaření), nebo ztráty (záporný výsledek hospodaření).
Hodnoty aktiv, pasiv a jejich složek (v tab. 15-3 jde o celková aktiva a vlastní kapitál) vyjadřují stavy na rozvahových účtech ke konci kalendářního roku. Náplň ukazatelů odpovídá účtové osnově pro podnikatele.
Pořízení dlouhodobého majetku představuje sumu výdajů, které vykazující jednotky vynaložily na pořízení dlouhodobého majetku (koupí, vytvořením vlastní činností, nabytím práv k výsledkům duševní tvořivé činnosti). Dlouhodobým majetkem se stávají věci uvedené do užívání. Uvedením do užívání se rozumí zabezpečení všech technických funkcí potřebných k užívání a splnění všech povinností stanovených právními předpisy, např. stavebními, ekologickými, požárními, bezpečnostními a hygienickými. Ukazatel nezahrnuje bezúplatně nabytý majetek a zahrnuje majetek pořízený na finanční leasing.
Tab. 15-5 Výroba vybraných výrobků
Produkce vybraných výrobků zahrnuje veškerou produkci daného výrobku nebo jejich agregátu vymezeného příslušným kódem. Jde o ukazatel typu hrubého obratu, který zahrnuje i objem produkce předané v rámci podnikatelského subjektu k další výrobě či do zásob. Obsah uvedených vybraných výrobků je specifikován Seznamem výrobků CZ-PRODCOM, který vychází z Klasifikace produkce (CZ-CPA). Tabulka 15-5 přitom obsahuje agregáty kódů CZ-PRODCOM vytvořené pro účely statistické ročenky. Zdrojem dat je specifické roční zjišťování, které zahrnuje pouze podniky s hlavní (převažující) průmyslovou činností s 20 a více zaměstnanci nebo významným ročním obratem, menší průmyslové jednotky s významným podílem na produkci konkrétního výrobku a vybrané neprůmyslové podniky s významným podílem průmyslové činnosti. Data za poslední uvedené období jsou vždy předběžná.
V návaznosti na nové právní předpisy upravující evropské standardy pro statistiku průmyslových výrobků a služeb byly upraveny publikační výstupy statistiky průmyslových výrobků a služeb ČR. Hlavní obsahovou změnou je důsledné zahrnutí produkce v režimu práce ve mzdě do publikovaných výstupů, a to počínaje daty za rok 2021 bez přepočtu historických časových řad. I když tento specifický dodavatelsko-odběratelský režim výroby nabývá v posledních letech celosvětově na významu, v rámci souhrnných výsledků za vybrané výrobky je v naprosté většině případů minoritní formou produkce a k porušení srovnatelnosti údajů v časové řadě nedošlo. Výrobky, u kterých je podíl nově zahrnuté práce ve mzdě významný, a v důsledku toho jsou údaje za rok 2021 výrazně odlišné od předchozích, jsou označeny poznámkou 1).

Methodological notes
The statistics of industry by economic activity includes enterprises principal (prevailing) activity of which is industry, i.e. that which is according to the Classification of Economic Activities (CZ-NACE) included in sections B (Mining and quarrying), C (Manufacturing), D (Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply), and E (Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities). A more detailed breakdown of the CZ-NACE includes 34 divisions.

All results published in this chapter represent the entire population of industrial enterprises irrespective of their size, unless otherwise stated.

Notes on Tables
Tables 15-1 and 15-2 Industrial production index
The industrial production index measures own output of industrial economic activities as well as industry in total adjusted for price effects. It is a basic indicator of the business cycle statistics of industry. When calculating the index, in large part, revenues from sales of own goods and services converted (deflated) to constant prices are used. In the case of selected economic activities, the production volumes of products-representatives are used to characterize the development of the industry (economic activity). The index is primarily calculated as a monthly fixed base index to the average month of the base period, which is currently the year 2021. The calculation starts at the level of the CZ-NACE two-digit divisions. Weights derived from the structure of the value added in the base year are used for higher-level aggregations (up to sections, Main Industrial Groupings, and industry in total). The fixed base indices provide the basis for year-on-year indices and cumulations over time, if any (quarterly, semi-annual, and annual). In compliance with regulations of Eurostat, the industrial production index covers sections B, C, D (excluding 35.3 group) of the CZ-NACE. The index is newly presented in calendar adjusted form, namely in the whole presented time series.

Concurrently with publishing the results for January 2024, the base period for short-term statistics changed. Indices are newly compared to the average of the year 2021 (it was 2015 before); new weighting schemes have been used that were derived from the results of structural business statistics for the year 2021. For conversion to constant prices, new price indices have been used (also based on the year 2021). For seasonal adjustment, new models in the JDEMETRA+ programme were created. Time series have been recalculated in their whole length, back to January 2000.

Tables 15-3, 15-4, and 15-6 Basic indicators of industry
Data in the Table 15-6 are taken from the processing of quarterly statistical forms (reports) of the labour market statistics. These results have to be taken for preliminary as they result from a survey with a limited size of the samples and a higher share of estimates. More detailed information about the survey and the methodology is provided in the Chapter 10 Labour Market.

Tables 15-3 and 15-4, on the other hand, contain data taken from the processing of annual statistical forms (reports), which provide a more detailed set of final data that are, however, available with a bigger delay. Along with publishing data for the year 2022, data for 2021 have also been concurrently revised.

With the processing of the data for 2022, a revision of the data for 2021 was also carried out. The revision primarily concerns two areas:
– refinement of labour and wage statistics indicators with an impact on all surveyed economic activities (industries);
– the revision of a part of financial indicators with an impact solely on the D section of the NACE classification.

As a result of the revisions made, the data for the affected indicators and economic activities (industries) for the years 2021 and 2022 are not fully comparable with the data published in the time series up to 2020.

It was possible to refine the estimate of labour and wage statistics indicators thanks to the wider use of available administrative data from the Czech Social Security Administration and the General Financial Directorate. The revision in this area was the most pronounced in the category of micro and small economic entities and affected the following indicators: the average registered number of employees, the average registered number of employees (FTE), the employed persons, the wages excl. other personnel expenses, the other personnel expenses, the average gross monthly wage per employee in the registered number of employees, the average gross monthly wage per FTE employee, and hours worked by employees.

A revision of financial indicators in the D section of the NACE classification is related to an additional adjustment of input data (reported by respondents) in the economic activity (industry) of production of electricity. The revision lies in a modification of how commodity futures contracts are captured with an impact on separation/split of revenues and expenses between an operating and a financial part of the profit and loss account. The revision was reflected the most in the following indicators: sales of own goods and services (i.e. revenues from sale of own goods and services), outputs, incl. trade margin, consumed materials, energy, and services, and the value added.

The average registered number of FTE employees includes persons with employment, service, or membership relation (where the membership also includes an employment contract) to the employer; it is the average registered number of employees (headcount) converted by their hours of work in relation to full-time working hours as determined by the employer. Wages excl. other personnel expenses comprise all money (basic wages, personal bonuses and other bonuses, rewards, company profit sharing, and wage compensations) charged to be paid to employees in the registered number of employees.

in compliance with relevant regulations on wages and salaries. They also include salaries of associates and members of cooperatives, provided that they have a contract of employment with a company and are kept in the registered number of employees. They also contain remunerations from distributable profit and from funds generated from profit. They exclude payments in connection with remuneration for work based on various contracts for work (agreements on work performed outside an employment contract, i.e. Czech “dohoda o provedení práce (DPP)” translated as “an agreement on work performance” and “dohoda o pracovní činnosti (DPČ)” translated as “an agreement on work activity” type of contract) and remuneration for members of bodies of companies (enterprises), i.e. payments to persons who are not included in the average registered number of employees.

Sales of goods and services are revenues from sales of own tangible and intangible output to external users. Sales of goods for resale are revenues from sales of goods for resale, i.e. products bought to be resold in an unchanged state. Outputs, incl. trade margin include sales of own goods and services, trade margin (the difference between revenues from the goods sold and costs of goods sold), change in inventories of own production, and capitalisation of material, goods, services, and fixed assets. Consumed materials, energy, and services – consumed purchases (the value of consumed material and energies) and costs of services (external services, costs of representation, and low-value intangible property not considered by the accounting unit to be fixed assets). Before the year 2016, the indicator called “production consumption” corresponded to this indicator as for its contents.

The value added is the difference between outputs, including the trade margin, and consumed materials, energy, and services. The economic result (profit/loss) is the difference between total revenues and total expenses in the reference period. This can take the form of either a profit (a positive economic result) or a loss (a negative economic result). Values of assets, liabilities, and their components (in Table 15-3 Assets, total and Equity) show balances on balance sheet accounts as at 31 December. The content of indicators corresponds to the chart of accounts for entrepreneurs.

The acquisition of fixed assets refers to total expenses outlaid by reporting units on the acquisition of fixed assets (by purchase, through own activity, by acquisition of intellectual property rights). Things that are put in use become fixed assets. Putting in use implies the provision of all technical functions required for the use and the meeting of all obligations laid down by legal regulations such as building regulations, environmental regulations, fire regulations, occupational safety regulations, and public health regulations (sanitary requirements). The indicator does not include assets acquired free of charge and includes assets acquired for financial leasing.

Table 15-5 Production of selected goods
The production of selected goods includes the whole production of a given item of goods or of an aggregate thereof, as defined by the respective code. It is an indicator of gross turnover, which also includes the volume of production passed over within the enterprise for further processing or for inclusion in inventories. The content of the mentioned selected goods is specified by the CZ-PRODCOM List, which is based on the Classification of Products by Activity (CZ-CPA). Table 15-5 contains aggregates of CZ-PRODCOM codes created for the purposes of the Statistical Yearbook of the Czech Republic. The following is the data source: a specific annual survey, which only includes enterprises the principal (prevailing) activity of which is industry with 20+ employees or with significant annual turnover, small industrial units with a significant share in production of specific goods, and selected non-industrial enterprises with a significant share of industrial activity. Data for the most recent period are always preliminary.

In compliance with new legal regulations providing for European standards for statistics of industrial goods and services, publication outputs of statistics of industrial goods and services of the Czech Republic have been modified. The main change in the contents is that production made within the production carried out under sub-contracted operations (also called contract processing) has been consistently included in published outputs, namely starting with data for the year 2021, without recalculating historical time series. Although this specific supplier-customer regime (way) of production has been gaining importance worldwide recently, within total results for selected goods it is in absolute majority of cases a minority form of production and the comparability of data in the time series has not been broken. As for goods having an important proportion of newly included production carried out under sub-contracted operations – resulting from which is that data for 2021 significantly differ from the data for the previous years – there is a note 1) added to the figure for 2021.

Metodické vysvětlivky
Zjišťování o těžbě, výrobě, zásobách a spotřebě paliv a energií bylo prováděno statistickými výkazy kombinací vyčerpávajícího a výběrového zjišťování. Údaje o zahraničním obchodu (Pohyb zboží z České republiky (vývoz) a Pohyb zboží do České republiky (dovoz)) s palivy a energií byly doplněny údaji ze statistiky zahraničního obchodu (dle systémů sběru dat Intrastat a Extrastat).

Poznámky k tabulkám
Tab. 16-1 a 16-2 Energetická bilance
Energetická bilance je publikována podle metodiky Eurostatu. Tato metodika bilancuje teplo vyrobené ve veřejné výrobně a teplo prodané třetí straně ze závodní výrobny. Vyrobené teplo použité ve vlastním podniku bilance neobsahuje, palivo spotřebované na výrobu tohoto tepla je vykazováno v sektoru konečné spotřeby.

Prvotní zdroje – uvádí se těžba prvotních zdrojů paliv na úrovni odbytové těžby po prvotní úpravě, zdroje obnovitelných paliv, elektřina z vodních sil, elektřina z větru, solárních zařízení apod. měřená na svorkách generátorů, výroba elektřiny a tepla v jaderných elektrárnách.

Jiné zdroje – ostatní evidované přírůstky paliv, např. černouhelné kaly, nebo čerpání (doplnění) zásob polotovarů kapalných paliv.

Pohyb zboží z České republiky (Vývoz) / Pohyb zboží do České republiky (Dovoz) obsahuje Pohyb zboží z České republiky (vývoz) / Pohyb zboží do České republiky (dovoz) všech druhů paliv a energie i ve formě meziproduktů uskutečněný podle platných předpisů, zahrnuje údaje podniků konfrontované s údaji statistiky zahraničního obchodu. Nezahrnují se tranzitní dodávky paliv a energie.

Změna stavu zásob – čerpání ze zásob (snížení zásob) zvyšuje disponibilní zdroje a je proto označeno (+), doplnění zásob (zvýšení zásob) omezuje tyto zdroje a je označeno (-).

Hrubá domácí spotřeba je součtem prvotních zdrojů, jiných zdrojů, recyklovaných produktů, pohybu zboží do České republiky (dovozu), množství čerpaného ze/do zásob a přímého užití sníženého o pohyb zboží z České republiky (vývoz).

Statistický rozdíl vzniká v důsledku časového posunu mezi evidencí výrobce a obchodních organizací a spotřebitelem.

V údajích vyjádřených v energetickém ekvivalentu vznikají rozdíly i odchylným vykázáním výhřevnosti zejména tuhých paliv výrobcem (dodavatelem) a spotřebitelem. Jedná se o rozdíl mezi zdroji a užitím.

Transformační vstup je množství paliv vstupujících do transformačního procesu (např. množství ropy vstupující do rafinérie).

Transformační výstup je množství energetických surovin vyrobených v transformačním procesu (např. výrobky z ropy – benzín, nafta, oleje apod.).

Konečná neenergetická spotřeba je konečná spotřeba paliv pro neenergetické účely (např. zemní plyn použitý na výrobu čpavku).

Konečná spotřeba je spotřeba paliv a energie zachycená před vstupem do spotřebičů, ve kterých se využije pro finální užitný efekt, nikoli pro výrobu jiné energie (s výjimkou druhotných energetických zdrojů).

Velkoodběr – odběratelé připojeni na síť VVN (nad 52 kV) nebo VN (od 1 do 52 kV).

Maloodběr – odběratelé připojeni na síť NN (do 1 kV).

Tab. 16-3 Výroba elektřiny a tepla z obnovitelných zdrojů energie a z odpadů
Vodní elektrárny – výroba elektřiny ve vodních elektrárnách je současně zařazena do tabulky 16-4 z důvodu metodického včlenění do celkové energetické bilance České republiky. Svou povahou však patří do obnovitelných zdrojů energie stejně tak jako výroba elektřiny ve větrných a solárních elektrárnách.

Výroba elektřiny ve vodních elektrárnách se zajišťuje převážně ve velkých a malých průtočných elektrárnách (využitím kinetické energie vody). Výroba elektřiny v přečerpávacích elektrárnách (využitím potenciální energie vody) není výrobou z obnovitelných zdrojů.

Větrné elektrárny vyrábějí elektřinu využitím kinetické energie větru.

Solární elektrárny (fotovoltaické) vyrábějí elektřinu přímo ze slunečního záření.

Biomasa je tuhá energeticky využitelná část organických (živočišných a rostlinných) odpadů a obnovitelné biomasy (rychle rostoucích rostlin a dřevin).

Průmyslové odpady jsou převážně tuhé a kapalné anorganické i organické nerecyklovatelné přímo spalované technologické odpady.

Komunální (městské) odpady jsou převážně tuhé netříděné (nerecyklovatelné) městské přímo spalované odpady.

Bioplyn je směs metanu a oxidu uhličitého vzniklá anaerobní (bez přístupu vzduchu) fermentací biomasy, dělící se v zásadě na skládkový bioplyn, splaškový (z čističek odpadních vod) bioplyn a ostatní, tj. např. vzniklý fermentací odpadů z potravinářských provozů (jatek, pivovarů apod.).

Tab. 16-4 Výroba elektřiny a ostatních energetických zdrojů
Výroba elektřiny celkem – výroba měřená na svorkách generátorů (hrubá). Celkový instalovaný výkon – nejvyšší činný elektrický výkon, který je elektrárna schopna dodávat při dodržení základních parametrů. Výroba tepla celkem (dodávka tepla pro rozvod – čistá výroba) – množství tepla vyrobeného v parních generátorech bez spotřeby na výrobu elektřiny a vlastní spotřeby a ztrát v kotelně.

Tab. 16-5 až 16-7 Bilance zemního plynu, černého uhlí a černouhelného koksu, hnědého uhlí, lignitu a hnědouhelných briket
Bilance jsou součástí energetické bilance a jsou vypracovány podle stejné metodiky. Bilance plynu je zpracována jednak v tepelných jednotkách, jednak v jednotkách naturálních. Konečná spotřeba zahrnuje velkoodběr, střední odběr, maloodběr, spotřebu domácností a ztráty. Velkoodběr představuje odběr spotřebitelů s roční spotřebou 4200 MWh a vyšší. Střední odběr představuje odběr s roční spotřebou od 630 MWh a menší než 4200 MWh. Maloodběr představuje odběr s roční spotřebou menší než 630 MWh určený pro podnikání. Domácnosti představují odběr s roční spotřebou menší než 630 MWh a určený pro spotřebu domácností.

Tab. 16-8 Energetická bilance rafinérského zpracování ropy (podle metodiky IEA)
Tato energetická bilance je zpracována podle mezinárodní metodiky pro OECD/IEA/EU/Eurostat. V roce 2015 došlo ke změně mezinárodní metodiky a v roce 2016 byla provedena mimořádná revize dat za referenční roky 2010 až 2015, což se zpětně promítlo do sledované časové řady. Domácí produkce a ostatní zdroje (těžba, nákup) – veškerá produkce na území státu. Rovněž se zde uvádí množství aditiv/oxigenátů a ostatních uhlovodíků dodávaných do rafinérií z jiných sektorů průmyslu. Zpětné toky z petrochemického průmyslu do rafinérií – dodávky obvykle vedlejších poloproduktů z petrochemického zpracování do rafinérií k dalšímu zpracování nebo mísení. Převedené produkty (reklasifikované) – uvádí se množství ropných produktů, které se reklasifikují na suroviny (nástřiky) pro další zpracování v rafinériích. Pohyb zboží z České republiky (Vývoz) (vstupy a výstupy) – vyjadřuje množství odeslaného zboží do zahraničí, které přestoupilo státní hranici za účelem jeho trvalého nebo dočasného ponechání v zahraničí. Celkový pohyb zboží z České republiky (vývoz) se tak skládá z odeslání do států EU a pohybu zboží z České republiky (vývozu) do třetích zemí (dle systémů sběru dat Intrastat a Extrastat). Pohyb zboží do České republiky (Dovoz) (vstupy a výstupy) – vyjadřuje množství zboží přijatého ze zahraničí, které přestoupilo státní hranici za účelem jeho trvalého nebo dočasného ponechání v tuzemsku. Celkový pohyb zboží do České republiky (dovoz) se tak skládá z přijetí ze států EU a pohybu zboží do České republiky (dovozu) ze třetích zemí (dle systémů sběru dat Intrastat a Extrastat). Přímé užití surovin – množství, které je použito přímo bez zpracování v rafinériích, např. množství surové ropy použité jako palivo pro výrobu elektřiny, tepla, množství biosložek použitých do směsí s motorovými palivy v rafinerii i mimo rafinérský sektor apod. Změna zásob – snížení zásob zvyšuje disponibilní zdroje a je proto označeno (+), zvýšení zásob omezuje tyto zdroje a je označeno (-). Rafinérský vstup (vypočítaný) – vypočítané množství ropy, rafinérských poloproduktů a produktů, které vstoupilo do rafinérského procesu. Definuje se takto: domácí produkce (těžba) + jiné zdroje (např. aditiva/oxygenáty, biosložky určené k namíchání do motorových paliv) + zpětné toky z petrochemického průmyslu do rafinérií + převedené produkty (reklasifikované) – pohyb zboží z České republiky (vývoz) + pohyb zboží do České republiky (dovoz) - přímé užití surovin + změna zásob. Statistický rozdíl – rozdíl mezi vypočítaným a zjištěným rafinérským vstupem. Tento rozdíl se může vyskytnout z různých důvodů, např. zaokrouhlováním, přepočítáváním m³ na tunu, stlačením v ropovodech apod. Rafinérský vstup (zjištěný) – skutečné množství ropy, rafinérských poloproduktů a produktů, které vstoupilo do rafinérského procesu.

Methodological notes
Data on mining, production, stock, and consumption of fuels and energy were obtained through statistical forms (reports), using a combination of an exhaustive survey and a sample survey. Data on cross border movements of goods from the Czech Republic (exports) and cross border movements of goods to the Czech Republic (imports) formerly called external trade in fuels and energy were completed by data of international trade statistics (according to the Intrastat and Extrastat data collection systems).

Notes on Tables
Tables 16-1 Total energy balance and 16-2 Balance of electricity
Energy balance is compiled in line with the Eurostat methodology. It is balancing heat produced in a public producer plant and heat sold to a third party from an autoproducer plant. Produced heat used in the own plant is not included in the balance; fuel used for production of that heat is reported in the final consumption sector.

Primary production includes the extraction of primary resources of fuels for sale (after primary treatment), sources of renewable fuels, electricity from water power, from the wind, solar installations and the like measured at generator terminals, production of electricity and heat in nuclear power plants.

Other sources – other recorded increases in fuels (e.g. coking coal sludge) and withdrawals from (or entries into) stock of liquid fuel feedstocks.

Cross border movements of goods from the Czech Republic (exports) / Cross border movements of goods to the Czech Republic (imports) comprise all kinds of fuels and energy, including intermediate products, brought to the country from abroad in accordance with legislation and regulations in force. They include enterprise data compared with international trade statistics data. Transit deliveries of fuels and energy are excluded.

Stock changes: withdrawals (+), entries (-) – a decrease in stock increases disposable sources and thus it is marked with (+), whereas an increase in stock reduces these sources and therefore it is marked with (-).

Gross inland consumption is the sum of primary resources, other sources, recycled products, cross border movements of goods to the Czech Republic (imports), stock withdrawals/entries, and direct uses minus cross border movements of goods from the Czech Republic (exports).

Statistical difference occurs as a result of time difference between the records of the manufacturer and trading organisations and consumers. Besides, figures expressed in energy equivalent show differences due to different heating values of fuels (solid fuels in particular) reported by the manufacturer (supplier) and the consumer. It is a difference between resources and uses.

Transformation input – an amount of fuels entering the transformation process (e.g. the amount of crude oil entering the refinery).

Transformation output – an amount of fuel materials produced in a transformation process (e.g. crude oil products – gasoline, diesel oil, fuel oils, and the like).

Final non-energy consumption – final consumption of fuels for non-energy purposes (e.g. natural gas used for production of ammonia).

Final consumption is the consumption of fuels and energy as measured immediately before they enter a device to generate the final effect, but not to produce any other type of energy in the device (with the exception of secondary energy sources).

High-voltage consumption – customers connected to the extra high voltage (over 52 kV) or the high voltage (1 to 52 kV) network.

Low-voltage consumption – customers connected to the low voltage (up to 1 kV) network.

Table 16-3 Production of electricity and heat from renewable energy sources and from wastes
Hydroelectric power plants – production of electricity in hydroelectric power plants is also included in the Table 16-4 due to methodological incorporation into the total energy balance of the Czech Republic. However, it belongs to renewable energy sources by its nature (as well as production of electricity in wind and solar power plants).

Production of electricity in hydroelectric power plants mostly takes place in large and small run-of-river plants (where the kinetic energy of water is used). Production of electricity in pumped storage plants (where the potential energy of water is used) is not production from renewable energy sources.

Wind power plants produce electricity using the kinetic energy of the wind.

Solar power plants (photovoltaic) produce electricity directly from the solar radiation.

Biomass is a solid fraction of organic wastes (vegetal and animal substances) and of renewable biomass (short-rotation coppice) that can be used for energy production.

Industrial wastes are non-recyclable mostly solid and liquid inorganic and organic technological wastes burnt directly.

In the total energy balance table (Tabulka 16-1) for the Czech Republic, the gross inland consumption of energy is calculated as the sum of primary resources, other sources, recycled products, cross border movements of goods to the Czech Republic (imports), stock withdrawals, and direct uses, minus cross border movements of goods from the Czech Republic (exports).
In the total energy balance table (Tabulka 16-1) for the Czech Republic, primary production includes the extraction of primary resources of fuels for sale, which is measured in tons.
In the total energy balance table (Tabulka 16-1) for the Czech Republic, stock changes are recorded as withdrawals (+) and entries (-), indicating the changes in available sources.
In the balance of electricity table (Tabulka 16-2) for the Czech Republic, high-voltage consumption is defined as the energy consumed by customers connected to the extra high voltage (over 52 kV) or high voltage (1 to 52 kV) network, measured in megawatt-hours (MWh).
In the balance of electricity table (Tabulka 16-2) for the Czech Republic, low-voltage consumption is defined as the energy consumed by customers connected to the low voltage (up to 1 kV) network, also measured in megawatt-hours (MWh).
In the production of electricity and heat from renewable energy sources and from wastes table (Tabulka 16-3) for the Czech Republic, the production of electricity in hydroelectric power plants is included, which is measured in megawatt-hours (MWh).
In the production of electricity and heat from renewable energy sources and from wastes table (Tabulka 16-3) for the Czech Republic, wind power plants produce electricity using the kinetic energy of the wind, measured in megawatt-hours (MWh).

Municipal wastes are mostly solid unsorted (non-recyclable) town wastes burnt directly. Biogas is a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide formed by anaerobic fermentation of biomass. In principle, it is split into landfill gas, sewage sludge gas (from waste water treatment plants), and other biogas, such as biogas produced by fermentation of waste from food-processing plants (abattoirs, breweries, etc.).

Table 16-4 Production of electricity and other energy sources
Electricity production, total – gross electricity output measured at generator terminals. Installed capacity, total – the highest active output a power generating plant can achieve and maintain under typical working conditions. Heat production, total (heat supply for distribution – net output) – heat produced by steam generators excluding heat used for electricity production, own consumption, and heat losses in the boiler plant.

Tables 16-5 to 16-7 Balance of natural gas, coking coal / other bituminous coal and coke-oven coke, lignite / brown coal and brown coal briquettes. The balances are part of the energy balance and are governed by the same methodology. The balance of natural gas is presented in heat units and volume units. Final consumption includes large-scale consumption, medium-scale consumption, small-scale consumption, residential consumption, and losses. Large-scale consumption - consumption of consumers with annual consumption of 4200 MWh and higher. Medium-scale consumption – consumption of consumers with annual consumption from 630 MWh up to and below 4200 MWh. Small-scale consumption – consumption of consumers with annual consumption below 630 MWh for business purposes. Residential (in households) – consumption of consumers with annual consumption below 630 MWh designated for consumption of households.

Table 16-8 Energy balance of crude oil refinery processing (by IEA methodology). This energy balance has been compiled according to the international methodology for OECD/IEA/EU/Eurostat. In 2015, the international methodology was changed; in 2016, an occasional data revision for the 2010 to 2015 reference years was made, which was retroactively implemented in the time series. Indigenous production and other sources (extraction, purchases) – all production in the country. They include also amounts of additives/oxygenates and other hydrocarbons supplied to refineries from other sectors of industry. Backflows from petrochemical industry to refineries – deliveries of (usually) by-products (refinery feedstock) from petrochemical processing to refineries for further processing or blending. Products transferred (reclassified) – amounts of crude oil products reclassified to raw materials (feedstock) for further processing in refineries. Cross border movements of goods from the Czech Republic (exports) (inputs and outputs) – refer to amounts of goods dispatched abroad that crossed the state border for the purpose of being left abroad, permanently or temporarily. Total cross border movements of goods from the Czech Republic (exports) thus consist of goods dispatched to the EU Member States and goods exported to third countries (according to the Intrastat and Extrastat data collection systems). Cross border movements of goods to the Czech Republic (imports) (inputs and outputs) – refer to amounts of goods received from abroad that crossed the state border for the purpose of being left in the Czech Republic, permanently or temporarily. Total cross border movements of goods to the Czech Republic (imports) thus consist of goods received from the EU Member States and goods imported from third countries (according to the Intrastat and Extrastat data collection systems). Direct use of resources – amounts used directly without any processing in refineries, e.g. amounts of crude oil serving as fuel to produce electricity, heat, amounts of biofuels used for motor fuel mixtures in the refinery and outside the refinery sector, etc. Stock changes: withdrawals (+), entries (-) – a decrease in stock increases disposable sources and thus it is marked with (+), whereas an increase in stock reduces these sources and therefore it is marked with (-). Refinery intake (calculated) – quantities of crude oil, refinery feedstocks, and products that entered the refinery process defined and calculated as follows: indigenous production (extraction) plus other sources (e.g. additives/oxygenates, biofuels for blending to motor fuels) plus backflows from petrochemical industry to refineries plus transferred (reclassified) products minus cross border movements of goods from the Czech Republic (exports) plus cross border movements of goods to the Czech Republic (imports) minus direct use of resources plus stock change.
