Metodické vysvětlivky
Statistika vědy, výzkumu a inovací poskytuje základní údaje o klíčových činnostech v oblastech vědy, technologií a inovací v České republice, jak z hlediska vstupů, tzn. finančních a kvalifikovaných lidských zdrojů, tak i jejich výsledků, jako jsou inovace, udělené patenty či zahraniční obchod s high-tech produkcí.

Věda představuje konzistentní systém verifikovatelných poznatků o skupině jevů a metody jejich získávání, zpracování, teoretického vysvětlení a praktického využití. Výzkum a vývoj je systematická tvůrčí práce konaná za účelem rozšíření stávajícího poznání, včetně poznání člověka, kultury a společnosti, získání nových znalostí nebo jejich využití v praxi, a to metodami, které umožňují potvrzení, doplnění či vyvrácení získaných poznatků.

Technologie vystupují ve třech základních formách: hmotné jako znalosti vtělené do fyzických objektů (stroje, zařízení, přístroje atd.); nehmotné jako znalosti akumulované v lidech (lidský kapitál), informace vtělené do elektronických médií a dokumentů (software, plány, projekty, výsledky pozorování, matematické výpočty, mapy atd.) a institucionální, tj. uspořádání činností a vztahů (organizační struktura, systém řízení, normy, předpisy atd.). Zatímco se tedy věda zajímá, jak a proč se určité věci dějí, technologie se zaměřují na prostředky, jakými jsou uskutečňovány.

Inovace představuje zavedení nového nebo podstatně zlepšeného produktu (výrobku nebo služby) nebo podnikového procesu, který se týká nových nebo výrazně zlepšených metod vnitřních procesů (výroba, logistika, IT systémy, administrativní činnosti), marketingu nebo významných organizačních změn v podniku.

Údaje uvedené v této kapitole byly získány převážně z pravidelných statistických zjišťování ČSÚ, a to především ze šetření o výzkumu a vývoji, šetření o licencích a z jiných datových zdrojů ČSÚ. V některých případech pak byly získány údaje z ostatních národních datových zdrojů, např. Úřadu průmyslového vlastnictví ČR, Úřadu vlády ČR, Ministerstva školství, mládeže a tělovýchovy aj.

Poznámky k tabulkám
Tab. 23-1 až 23-6 Výzkum a vývoj
Výzkum a vývoj (dále jen VaV) je systematická tvůrčí práce konaná za účelem rozšíření stávajícího poznání, včetně poznání člověka, kultury a společnosti, získání nových znalostí nebo jejich využití v praxi, a to metodami, které umožňují potvrzení, doplnění či vyvrácení získaných poznatků (OECD 2015, Frascati manuál). Základním pravidlem pro určení, zda se jedná o VaV činnost, je přítomnost prvku novosti, kreativity, nejistoty, systematičnosti a reprodukovatelnosti.

Rozlišují se tři základní typy VaV činnosti. Základní výzkum, kterým se rozumí experimentální a teoretická práce vynakládaná zásadně za účelem získání nových vědomostí o základních principech jevů nebo pozorovatelných skutečností, která není primárně zaměřena na uplatnění nebo využití v praxi. Aplikovaný výzkum, kterým se rozumí plánovitý výzkum nebo kritické šetření zaměřené na získání nových poznatků a dovedností pro vývoj nových výrobků, postupů nebo služeb nebo ke značnému zdokonalení stávajících výrobků, postupů nebo služeb. Výsledky aplikovaného výzkumu jsou směřovány ke specifickému a praktickému cíli. Experimentální vývoj, kterým se rozumí získávání, spojování, formování a používání stávajících vědeckých, technologických, obchodních a jiných poznatků a dovedností pro návrh nových nebo podstatně zdokonalených výrobků, postupů nebo služeb.

Charakteristiky výzkumu a vývoje jsou sledovány prostřednictvím Ročního výkazu o výzkumu a vývoji, který obsahuje otázky o lidských a finančních zdrojích určených k VaV činnostem uskutečněným na území České republiky v jednotlivých sektorech provádění VaV. Statistické šetření plně respektuje metodické principy Evropské unie (EU) a Organizace pro hospodářskou spolupráci a rozvoj (OECD) uvedené ve Frascati manuálu a nařízení Evropského parlamentu a Rady (EU) 2019/2152.

Zpravodajskými jednotkami v oblasti statistického zjišťování o VaV jsou všechny právnické a fyzické osoby, které provádějí VaV na území České republiky jako svoji hlavní (CZ-NACE 72 – Výzkum a vývoj) nebo vedlejší ekonomickou činnost, a to bez ohledu na počet jejich zaměstnanců, sektor nebo činnost (CZ-NACE), ve které působí.

Sektor provádění výzkumu a vývoje je základní kategorií používanou ve statistice VaV, jež seskupuje všechny institucionální jednotky provádějící VaV na základě jejich hlavních funkcí, chování a cílů. Ukazatele VaV jsou standardně sledovány a publikovány, a to i na mezinárodní úrovni, ve čtyřech sektorech provádění VaV (dále jen sektorech) – podnikatelský, vládní, vysokoškolský a soukromý neziskový. Tyto sektory byly vymezeny na základě Číselníku institucionálních sektorů a subsektorů používaného v Národních účtech (Evropský systém účtů 2010) a definic uvedených ve Frascati manuálu:

– podnikatelský sektor (S.11: Nefinanční podniky; S.12: Finanční instituce; S.141: Zaměstnavatelé a S.142: Osoby samostatně výdělečně činné) zahrnuje všechny firmy, organizace a instituce, jejichž hlavní činností je tržní výroba zboží nebo služeb pro prodej široké veřejnosti za ekonomicky významnou cenu. Podnikatelský sektor je zaměřený především na aplikovaný výzkum a experimentální vývoj. Výsledky těchto činností souvisí především s inovacemi, tj. vývojem nových či zlepšením stávajících výrobků nebo poskytovaných služeb. Subjekty a pracoviště VaV v podnikatelském sektoru jsou členěny podle druhu pracoviště na základě vlastnictví, a to na veřejné podniky, soukromé domácí podniky a podniky pod zahraniční kontrolou;

– vládní sektor (S.13: Vládní instituce) zahrnuje orgány státní správy a samosprávy na všech úrovních s výjimkou veřejně řízeného vyššího odborného a vysokého školství (CZ-NACE 854). Tento sektor v ČR zahrnuje především jednotlivá

Věda, výzkum a inovace
Science, research, and innovation
pracoviště Akademie věd České republiky a ostatní veřejné výzkumné instituce. Dále pak zahrnuje veřejné knihovny, archivy,
muzea, zdravotnická zařízení (bez fakultních nemocnic) a ostatní pracoviště vládního sektoru, která provádějí VaV jako svoji
vedlejší činnost;
– vysokoškolský sektor (CZ-NACE 854: Postsekundární vzdělávání) zahrnuje všechny veřejné i soukromé univerzity, vysoké
školy a další instituce pomaturitního vzdělávání a také všechny výzkumné ústavy, experimentální zařízení a kliniky pracující
pod přímou kontrolou nebo řízené či spojené s organizacemi vyššího vzdělávání (např. fakultní nemocnice). Tento sektor
není samostatným institucionálním sektorem, byl však odděleně identifikován OECD pro svou důležitou roli ve výzkumu
a vývoji;
– soukromý neziskový sektor      (S.15: Neziskové instituce sloužící domácnostem) zahrnuje soukromé instituce, včetně
soukromých osob a domácností, jejichž primárním cílem není tvorba zisku, ale poskytování netržních služeb domácnostem.
Jedná se např. o sdružení výzkumných organizací, spolky, svazy, společnosti, kluby, hnutí či nadace. Soukromý neziskový
sektor je v rámci provádění VaV zanedbatelný.
Poznámka - Meziroční změny údajů o výzkumu a vývoji podle sektorů provádění, druhu pracoviště, vlastnictví nebo odvětví
mohou být způsobeny přeřazením sledovaných subjektů, například při změně majitele, převažující ekonomické činnosti, právní
formy nebo institucionálního sektoru.
Výzkumné a vývojové činnosti se sledují především ve vládním a vysokoškolském sektoru v následujících šesti hlavních
skupinách vědních oblastí definovaných podle mezinárodní Klasifikace oblastí výzkumu a vývoje (Fields of Research
and Development Classification):
– přírodní vědy zahrnující matematiku, počítačové vědy a informatiku, fyzikální vědy, chemické vědy, vědy o Zemi a příbuzné
vědy o životním prostředí, biologické vědy a ostatní přírodní vědy;
– technické vědy zahrnující stavební a dopravní inženýrství, elektrotechnické, elektronické a informační inženýrství, strojní,
jaderné a audio inženýrství, chemické inženýrství, materiálové inženýrství, lékařské inženýrství, environmentální inženýrství,
environmentální biotechnologie, průmyslové biotechnologie, nanotechnologie a ostatní technické vědy;
– lékařské vědy zahrnující základní medicínu, klinickou medicínu, zdravotní vědy, lékařské biotechnologie a ostatní lékařské
vědy;
– zemědělské vědy    zahrnující zemědělství, lesnictví a rybářství, vědy o zvířatech a mléce, veterinární vědy, zemědělskou
biotechnologii a ostatní zemědělské vědy;
– sociální vědy zahrnující psychologii, ekonomii a podnikání, vzdělávací vědy, sociologii, právní vědy, politické vědy, sociální
a ekonomickou geografii, média a komunikaci a ostatní sociální vědy;
– humanitní vědy    zahrnující historii a archeologii, jazyky a literaturu, filozofii, etiku a náboženství, umění (umění, historie
umění, herecké umění, hudba) a ostatní humanitní vědy.
Údaje o VaV podle hlavních skupin vědních oblastí jsou založeny na převažující vědní oblasti sledovaných pracovišť VaV.
Pracovníci ve výzkumu a vývoji
Osoby pracující ve výzkumu a vývoji (dále jen pracovníci ve VaV) tvoří výzkumní pracovníci, pomocní, techničtí, odborní,
administrativní a jiní pracovníci pracující na pracovištích VaV v jednotlivých zpravodajských jednotkách, kteří obstarávají přímé
služby pro tato pracoviště. Kategorie pracovníků ve VaV zahrnuje všechny osoby ve věku od 15 let, které jsou placeny
v zaměstnání. Formální vazbou k zaměstnání se rozumí především pracovní poměr, dohoda o provedení práce a dohoda
o pracovní činnosti.
Pracovníci ve VaV se rozlišují podle jejich prováděné pracovní činnosti (zaměstnání) na:
– výzkumné pracovníky, kteří se zabývají koncepcí nebo tvorbou nových znalostí, výrobků, procesů, metod a systémů, nebo
takové projekty řídí. Jde převážně o vědecké a odborné duševní pracovníky a vedoucí pracovníky VaV útvarů;
– technické a odborné pracovníky     (dále jen techničtí pracovníci), kteří se účastní výzkumu a vývoje uskutečňováním
vědeckých a technických úkolů, aplikováním konceptů a provozních metod, obvykle za dohledu výzkumných pracovníků;
– ostatní pracovníky ve výzkumu a vývoji – řemeslníci, sekretářky a úředníci, kteří se podílí na VaV činnostech nebo jsou
začleněni do takových prací; zahrnuti jsou i manažeři a administrativní pracovníci, jejichž činnosti jsou přímou službou VaV.
Počet pracovníků ve VaV je zjišťován pomocí dvou základních ukazatelů, jimiž jsou počet fyzických osob (HC) a přepočtený
počet osob na ekvivalent plné roční pracovní doby věnované výzkumným a vývojovým činnostem (FTE):
– fyzické osoby vypovídají o evidenčním počtu osob plně či částečně aktivních ve výzkumných a vývojových činnostech,
zaměstnaných na základě hlavního nebo vedlejšího pracovního poměru ke konci příslušného roku ve sledovaných
subjektech. Především ve vysokoškolském a částečně i ve vládním sektoru má velké množství osob pracujících ve VaV,
zvláště výzkumných   pracovníků,  pracovní  úvazek  ve  více  subjektech, proto  je v těchto sektorech  tento ukazatel
nadhodnocený a nevypovídá tak o skutečném počtu osob pracujících ve VaV;
– přepočtené osoby vypovídají o průměrném evidenčním počtu pracovníků ve VaV přepočteném na plný roční pracovní
úvazek věnovaný výzkumným a vývojovým činnostem (FTE). Jeden FTE se rovná jednomu roku práce (na plný pracovní
úvazek) zaměstnance, který se na 100 % věnuje VaV činnosti. Ukazatel FTE v sobě zahrnuje také počet osob pracujících
pro zpravodajskou jednotku na základě dohod o provedení práce a o pracovní činnosti přepočtených dle metodiky platné pro
FTE.

Výdaje na výzkum a vývoj
Výdaje na výzkum a vývoj zahrnují veškeré běžné (mzdové a ostatní) a kapitálové (investiční) výdaje vynaložené v průběhu sledovaného roku na VaV prováděný ve sledovaných subjektech na území daného státu, a to bez ohledu na zdroj nebo způsob jejich financování. Do sledovaných (vnitřních) výdajů na VaV nepatří tzv. vnější (extramural) výdaje vynaložené na VaV provedený mimo sledovaný subjekt, sektor nebo stát. Do vnitřních výdajů na VaV tak nepatří výdaje vynaložené za nákup služeb VaV od subjektů provádějících VaV, prostředky převedené ostatním spoluřešitelům v rámci společného VaV projektu a dotace či příspěvky (finanční transfery) poskytnuté třetím osobám na u nich prováděný VaV.

Celkové výdaje za výzkum a vývoj, provedený na území daného státu, jsou statisticky sledovány pomocí ukazatele hrubé domácí výdaje na VaV (GERD). Tento ukazatel v sobě zahrnuje obdržené finanční prostředky ze zahraničí na VaV prováděný na území daného státu, ale vylučuje tuzemské finanční prostředky poskytnuté na VaV prováděný v zahraničí. Výše výdajů na VaV uskutečněných v sektorech provádění je sledována podle hlavních zdrojů financování VaV činností:
– podnikové, jež tvoří především vlastní zdroje sledovaných podniků určené na u nich prováděný VaV a zdroje mateřských podniků financujících VaV v jejich zahraničních afilacích v ČR. U vládního a vysokoškolského sektoru zahrnuje financování z podnikových zdrojů především příjmy z prodejů služeb VaV (zakázky na VaV) a příjmy z licenčních poplatků za nehmotné výsledky VaV;
– veřejné domácí, které pocházejí ze státního rozpočtu nebo rozpočtů krajů určené na VaV prováděný na území ČR;
– veřejné zahraniční, které zahrnují především příjmy ze strukturálních fondů EU. Dále sem patří ostatní zdroje z rozpočtu EU a zdroje z mezinárodních organizací mimo EU (CERN, ILL, NATO, OSN, WHO, Norské fondy/EHP aj.).

Kromě výše uvedených hlavních zdrojů se na financování VaV podílejí i ostatní domácí zdroje, které tvoří především vlastní příjmy vysokých škol a soukromých neziskových institucí nepocházející ze státního rozpočtu, podnikatelského sektoru ani ze zahraničí. Tyto zdroje jsou v rámci celkových výdajů na VaV u nás zanedbatelné.

Tab. 23-7 až 23-11 Státní rozpočtové výdaje na výzkum a vývoj
Statistika státních rozpočtových výdajů na VaV je zabezpečována s roční periodicitou na základě nařízení Evropského parlamentu a Rady (EU) 2019/2152 a metodiky uvedené ve Frascati manuálu (OECD, 2015). Seznam socioekonomických cílů je uveden v Nomenklatuře pro analýzu a srovnání vědeckých programů a rozpočtů (NABS, Eurostat 2007). V ČR je statistika státních rozpočtových výdajů na VaV zajišťována na základě administrativních údajů převzatých z Informačního systému výzkumu, vývoje a inovací. Částečně jsou údaje získávány přímo od jednotlivých poskytovatelů veřejné podpory VaV. Statistika přímé veřejné podpory VaV zohledňuje terminologii a specifikaci výdajů dané zákonem č. 130/2002 Sb., o podpoře výzkumu, experimentálního vývoje a inovací z veřejných prostředků (v jeho novelizovaném znění). Státní rozpočtové výdaje na VaV zahrnují v případě ČR veškeré finanční prostředky poskytnuté ze státního rozpočtu na podporu VaV, včetně prostředků plynoucích na VaV do zahraničí. Z veřejných prostředků na VaV je dle platné mezinárodní metodiky vyloučena podpora VaV realizovaná pomocí návratných půjček, předfinancování programů EU krytých příjmy z Evropské unie a podpora inovací. Veškeré údaje o státních rozpočtových výdajích na VaV vychází z údajů uvedených v závěrečném účtu státního rozpočtu ČR pro oblast VaV. Jedná se o výdaje, které byly ze státního rozpočtu v daném roce na VaV opravdu čerpány, a nikoliv o částky schválené v zákoně o státním rozpočtu na daný rok.

Tab. 23-12 Daňová podpora výzkumu a vývoje v soukromých podnicích
Daňová podpora výzkumu a vývoje je uplatněný odečet výdajů na realizaci projektů VaV z daně příjmů právnických a fyzických osob. Údaje o daňové podpoře VaV jsou statisticky sledovány od roku 2007. Administrativním zdrojem dat jsou daňová přiznání. Statisticky jsou sledovány pouze právnické osoby (podniky) v institucionálních sektorech S.11: Nefinanční podniky a S.12: Finanční instituce. Informace o fyzických osobách (podnikatelích) nejsou k dispozici. Daňová podpora VaV se počítá na základě následujícího vzorce: Daňová podpora VaV = uplatněný odečet nákladů na VaV od základu daně x sazba daně. Odpočet nelze uplatnit na služby a nehmotné výsledky výzkumu a vývoje (vyjma pořízených od veřejných vysokých škol, veřejných výzkumných organizací a ostatních výzkumných organizací uvedených v zákoně č. 130/2002 Sb., o podpoře výzkumu, experimentálního vývoje a inovací z veřejných prostředků). Úplný výčet náležitostí / uznatelných nákladů lze nalézt v pokynu Ministerstva financí č. MF-17.

Licence je jednou z možností, jak komerčně využít průmyslová práva a duševní vlastnictví. Licenční smlouva je poskytnutí práva ve sjednaném rozsahu a na sjednaném území na nabytí či poskytnutí patentovaných i nepatentovaných vynálezů. Poskytovatel opravňuje nabyvatele ve sjednaném rozsahu a na sjednaném území k výkonu práv z průmyslového vlastnictví a nabyvatel se zavazuje k poskytování určité úplaty, nebo jiné majetkové hodnoty.

Podle předmětu licence rozeznáváme licence patentové, jejichž předmětem je poskytnutí práva využívat platný patent buď v zemi nabyvatele, nebo v zemích, kam má nabyvatel licence úmysl licenční výrobek vyvážet, licence vzorové, jejichž předmětem je průmyslový nebo užitný vzor, licence na know-how, jejichž předmětem je poskytnutí nechráněných výrobně-technických poznatků, znalostí či zkušeností.

ČSÚ sleduje údaje o poskytnutých licencích v oblasti ochrany průmyslového vlastnictví prostřednictvím Ročního výkazu o licencích. Toto šetření je koncipováno jako vyčerpávající. Z hlediska šíření výsledků výzkumu a vývoje a jejich finančního zhodnocení patří mezi nejvýznamnější předměty licenčních smluv poskytnuté patentové licence, na které se ČSÚ ve svém šetření primárně zaměřuje. Zpravodajské jednotky pro zjištění poskytnutých patentových licencí tvoří všechny tuzemské právnické osoby s platným patentem pro území České republiky k 31. prosinci sledovaného roku.

Data jsou dostupná v třídění podle sektorů (podnikatelský, vládní, vysokoškolský) definovaných v souladu s metodikou sektorů provádění VaV (viz definice uvedeny u poznámek k tabulkám 23-1 až 23-6 Výzkum a vývoj).

Tab. 23-14 až 23-16 Patentová aktivita
Patent je veřejná listina vydaná příslušným patentovým úřadem, která poskytuje právní ochranu na vynález po dobu až 20 let (jsou-li placeny udržovací poplatky), a to na teritoriu, pro něž byl tímto úřadem vydán. Patentovou ochranu na území České republiky zajišťuje Úřad průmyslového vlastnictví ČR (ÚPV ČR).

Patenty se udělují na vynálezy, které jsou nové, jsou výsledkem vynálezecké činnosti a jsou průmyslově využitelné. Patentovat lze nejen výrobky a technologie, ale i chemicky vyrobené látky, léčiva, průmyslové produkční mikroorganismy, jakož i mikrobiologické způsoby a výrobky těmito způsoby získané. Patentovat naopak nelze objevy nebo vědecké teorie, programy pro počítače, nové odrůdy rostlin a plemena zvířat či způsoby chirurgického nebo terapeutického ošetřování lidského nebo zvířecího těla a diagnostické metody používané na lidském nebo zvířecím těle.

Patentová statistika přináší informace o výsledcích a úspěšnosti výzkumné, vývojové a inovační činnosti ve vybraných oblastech techniky. Údaje v této kapitole byly zpracovány ČSÚ na základě datových zdrojů ÚPV ČR (tab. 23-14 a 23-15) a Světové organizace duševního vlastnictví – WIPO (tab. 23-16).

Patent může být udělen tzv. národní cestou, kdy je přihláška podaná přímo u ÚPV ČR. Tuto možnost využívají především tuzemští přihlašovatelé. Druhou možností, kterou volí zejména zahraniční přihlašovatelé, je validace patentu, uděleného Evropským patentovým úřadem, pro území Česka. Tuto validaci provádí, po splnění zákonných podmínek, ÚPV ČR.

Patentová data uvedená v tabulkách 23-14 a 23-15 jsou tříděná tzv. zlomkovou metodou (např. pokud dva přihlašovatelé z různých zemí podají společně patentovou přihlášku, každé zemi se připíše jedna polovina tohoto patentu). Data v tabulce 23-16 jsou tříděna podle země prvního uvedeného přihlašovatele.

Tab. 23-17 a 23-18 Inovující podniky
Údaje o inovacích obsažené v této kapitole jsou získány na základě statistického šetření o inovacích v podnicích, které se uskutečňuje za účelem zmapování inovačního potenciálu podniků působících v České republice. Statistické šetření plně respektuje metodické principy Evropské unie (EU) a Organizace pro hospodářskou spolupráci a rozvoj (OECD) uvedené v Oslo manuálu (OECD, 2018) a nařízení Evropského parlamentu a Rady (EU) 2019/2152. Základní soubor statistického šetření zahrnuje zpravodajské jednotky podnikatelského sektoru s více než 10 zaměstnanými osobami ve vybraných klíčových odvětvích podle klasifikace CZ-NACE.

Předmětem statistického šetření jsou inovace produktů a inovace podnikových procesů. Produktovou inovací se rozumí uvedení nového nebo zlepšeného výrobku nebo služby na trh. Inovované produkty se musí významně lišit od předchozích, které byly podnikem uvedeny na trh již dříve. Jde o výrobky nebo služby, jejichž funkční charakteristiky (např. technické specifikace, použité komponenty a materiály, software, uživatelská vstřícnost) nebo zamýšlené použití se významně liší od předcházejících produktů podniku. Zahrnuje i významné změny v designu, které mění technické, užitné či funkční vlastnosti produktu.

Za produktovou inovaci se nepovažují mírná nebo nepatrná zlepšení, rutinní modernizace, sezónní změny (např. oděvů) či estetické změny designu, jež nemění funkční, technické nebo užitné vlastnosti produktu. Inovací podnikových procesů se rozumí zavedení nových nebo zlepšených podnikových činností, které se významně liší od těch, které podnik využíval v minulosti. Za inovaci podnikových procesů se nepovažují malá či rutinní zlepšení, jež se z hlediska změn, funkcí a výsledků příliš neliší od těch předchozích.
[/X][P][X]
Věda, výzkum a inovace
Science, research, and innovation
Mezi inovace podnikových procesů se řadí:
–    Inovace interních procesů, tj. zavedení nového nebo zlepšeného způsobu provádění:
–   výroby nebo poskytování služeb;
–   logistických činností (např. zásobování, skladování, manipulace s materiálem či distribuce);
–   zpracování podnikových informací, interní komunikace či jejich zabezpečení;
–   účetnictví, finančnictví (např. controllingu) či jiných administrativních činností.
Inovace interních procesů zahrnují pouze významné změny používaných technologií, zařízení nebo softwaru za účelem
zdokonalení kvality, efektivnosti nebo flexibility produkce, dodavatelské činnosti a ostatních podpůrných podnikových činností
jako je údržba, nákup, účetnictví, ICT podpora nebo snížení ohrožení (zátěže) životního prostředí či bezpečnostních rizik.
–    Marketingová inovace, tj. zavedení následujících změn v marketingu nebo v prodeji:
–   nový design produktu k dosažení lepšího estetického dojmu;
–   nový obal či způsob balení produktu, který se významně liší od předchozích (např. zásadní změna materiálu použitého
na obal, výrazně odlišný vzhled balení produktu);
–   nový způsob propagace nebo reklamy (např. využití nového propagačního kanálu jako jsou sociální sítě, internetová
reklama, vybudování nové značky, zavedení věrnostních karet);
–   nová cenová strategie;
–   nový způsob prodeje.
Marketingová inovace se zaměřuje na lepší splnění potřeb zákazníka, vstup na nové trhy nebo nalezení nového místa na trhu
a jejím cílem je zvýšení objemu prodejů. Marketingová inovace se od dalších marketingových nástrojů firmy odlišuje zavedením
marketingové metody, kterou dříve firma nepoužívala.
–    Organizační inovace, tj. zavedení nového nebo zlepšeného způsobu organizace či řízení:
–   lidských zdrojů;
–   dodavatelsko-odběratelských vztahů;
–   ostatních podnikových činností (např. řízení kvality nebo toků znalostí);
–   spolupráce s jinými subjekty (např. vytváření strategických aliancí či odvětvových klastrů);
–   využití outsourcingu části podnikových činnosti.
V případě organizačních inovací se jedná o zásadní změnu organizační struktury, manažerských metod nebo spolupráce
s jinými subjekty, které nebyly v podniku dříve používané, a to za účelem zlepšení využívání znalostí, kvality nebo zefektivnění
průběhu prováděných činností.
Inovující podniky jsou podniky, které během sledovaného období zavedly alespoň jednu z výše uvedených inovací.

Tab. 23-19 až 23-22 Náklady a tržby za inovace v podnicích
Celkové náklady související s inovacemi ve sledovaném období zahrnují: náklady na vnitropodnikový výzkum a vývoj,
nákup služeb výzkumu a vývoje, pořízení strojů, zařízení, softwaru a budov (technické a programové vybavení pořízené
pro zavedení nových nebo významně zlepšených produktů a/nebo procesů), pořízení či licencování předmětů duševního
vlastnictví (zaplacené licenční poplatky či nákup patentů, užitných a průmyslových vzorů, výrobně-technických poznatků
a postupů, ochranných známek či autorských práv od jiných subjektů za účelem jejich využití ve firemních inovacích) a náklady
na ostatní inovační činnosti (design, školení, uvádění inovací na trh a jiné činnosti související s prováděnými inovacemi).
Celkové tržby podniků s produktovou inovací jsou tržby inovujících podniků, které zavedly v daném období produktovou
inovaci. Jsou členěny na tržby za inovované produkty (nové na trhu, nové pro podnik) a tržby za nezměněné nebo málo
modifikované produkty (výrobky nebo služby, u kterých chybí prvek „novosti“ a nejsou považovány za inovované).

Tab. 23-27 Zahraniční obchod s high-tech zbožím. Zbožím s vysokou technologickou náročností (dále jen high-tech zboží) se rozumí výrobky, jejichž výroba a zpracování vyžadují v převažující míře špičkové, technologicky velmi pokročilé a náročné provozy. Vývoj těchto produktů provází zpravidla relativně vysoké náklady na výzkum, vývoj a inovace. High-tech zboží je v rámci statistiky zahraničního obchodu vymezeno podle Standardní mezinárodní obchodní klasifikace (SITC). Eurostat vypracoval seznam high-tech zboží podle čtvrté revize výše uvedené klasifikace (SITC, Rev. 4) platné od roku 2007. High-tech zboží je podle této klasifikace rozděleno do devíti hlavních kategorií. Data za vývoz a dovoz high-tech zboží pocházejí z datových výstupů statistiky zahraničního obchodu, která sleduje skutečný obchod se zbožím realizovaný mezi českými a zahraničními subjekty, tedy obchod, kdy dochází ke změně vlastnictví mezi rezidenty a nerezidenty.

Tab. 23-28 Zahraniční obchod s technologickými službami. Zahraniční obchod s technologickými službami sleduje prodej a nákup nehmotných technologií dané země ve vztahu k ostatním ekonomikám. Údaje o příjmech, resp. platbách získaných v rámci zahraničního obchodu s technologickými službami vyjadřují technologickou úroveň ekonomiky, tj. informují o rozsahu zahraničního obchodu s průmyslovým vlastnictvím a znalostmi spojenými s vyspělými technologiemi. Základní metodologie a koncepce statistiky technologické platební bilance, která v sobě zahrnuje zahraniční obchod s technologickými službami, je založena na manuálu TBP Manual, OECD, 1990. Data za vývoz a dovoz technologických služeb pocházejí z přímého šetření ČSÚ o vývozu a dovozu služeb. Jednotlivé položky těchto služeb jsou vymezeny na základě Rozšířené klasifikace služeb v platební bilanci (EBOPS 2010) následovně:

Methodological notes
Science, research, and innovation statistics provides basic data on key activities in the areas of science, technologies, and innovations in the Czech Republic (CR) from the point of view of inputs, i.e. financial and qualified human resources as well as their results such as innovations, granted patents, or international trade in high-tech products. Science refers to a consistent system of verifiable observations and findings on a given set of phenomena as well as of methods used to obtain, process, to explain in theory, and apply these observations and findings.

Research and development comprise creative and systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge – including knowledge of humankind, culture, and society – and to devise new applications of available knowledge. Technologies take three fundamental forms: tangible: knowledge embodied in physical objects (machinery, equipment, instruments, etc.); intangible: knowledge accumulated in people (human capital), information embodied in electronic media and documents (software, plans, projects, results of observations, mathematical calculations, maps, etc.), and institutional: arrangement of activities and relations (organisational structure, management system, standards, regulations, etc.). Thus, while science is concerned about how and why certain things happen, technology is focusing on the means by which they are implemented.

An innovation is the introduction of a new or significantly improved product (good or service) or business process that involves new or significantly improved methods of internal processes (production, logistics, IT systems, administrative activities), marketing or significant organisational changes in the company. Data provided in the Chapter had been mainly obtained from regular statistical surveys of the Czech Statistical Office (CZSO), primarily from the survey on research and development, survey on licences, and from other data sources of the CZSO. In some cases, data had been obtained from other national data sources, e.g. the Industrial Property Office of the CR, the Office of the Government of the CR, the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports, etc.

Notes on Tables
Tables 23-1 to 23-6 Research and development (R&D)
Research and experimental development (hereinafter referred to as R&D) comprise creative and systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge – including knowledge of humankind, culture and society – and to devise new applications of available knowledge (OECD 2015, Frascati Manual). For an activity to be a R&D activity, it must satisfy five core criteria; it must be: novel, creative, uncertain, systematic, transferable and/or reproducible. The term R&D covers three types of activity: basic research, applied research, and experimental development. Basic research is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts, without any particular application or use in view. Applied research is original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge. It is, however, directed primarily towards a specific, practical aim or objective. Experimental development is systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience and producing additional knowledge, which is directed to producing new products or processes or to improving existing products or processes.

Characteristics of research and development are surveyed by the Annual report (questionnaire) on research and development, which includes questions on human and financial resources earmarked for R&D activities realized in the territory of the Czech Republic in respective sectors of R&D performance. The statistical survey fully complies with methodological principles of the European Union (EU) and of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) mentioned in the Frascati Manual and in the Regulation (EU) 2019/2152 of the European Parliament and of the Council.

Reporting units in the R&D survey are all legal and natural persons performing R&D in the territory of the Czech Republic as their principal (CZ-NACE 72 – Scientific research and development) or secondary economic activity, irrespective of the number of personnel, sector, or CZ-NACE activity. Sector of research and development performance is a basic category used in R&D statistics, which groups all institutional units performing R&D based on their main functions, behaviour, and objectives. R&D indicators are usually measured and published, also at an international level, in four sectors of R&D performance (hereinafter referred to as sectors): the business enterprise sector, the government sector, the higher education sector, and the private non-profit sector. These sectors were defined based on the Classification of Institutional Sectors and Subsectors used in the national accounts (the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010)) and definitions given in the Frascati Manual:

– business enterprise sector (S.11: Non-financial corporations; S.12: Financial corporations; S.141: Employers, and S.142: Own-account workers), which comprises all companies, organisations, and institutions, principal activity of which is market production of goods or services for sale to the general public at an economically significant price. The business enterprise sector mainly focuses on applied research and experimental development. Results of these activities are especially related to innovations, i.e. development of new products or improvement of the existing ones or of provided services. Entities and R&D workplaces in the business enterprise sector are broken down by type of workplace based on the ownership, namely to public enterprises (corporations), private national enterprises (corporations), and foreign-controlled enterprises (corporations).
[/X][P][X]
Věda, výzkum a inovace
Science, research, and innovation

– government sector (S.13: General government) comprises bodies of central and local government, except for publicly managed higher education institutions (CZ-NACE 85.4). This sector especially includes in the Czech Republic workplaces of the Czech Academy of Sciences and other public research institutions. It further includes public libraries, archives, museums, health establishments (excluding teaching hospitals), and other workplaces of the government sector, which perform R&D as their secondary activity;

– higher education sector (CZ-NACE 85.4: Higher education) comprises all public and private universities and other institutions of post-secondary education with R&D activities and also all research institutes, experimental facilities, and clinics, work of which is directly controlled or managed by higher education institutions or that are associated with them (e.g. teaching hospitals). This sector is not a separate institutional sector, however, it has been separately identified by the OECD because of its important role in R&D;

– private non-profit sector (S.15: Non-profit institutions serving households) comprises private institutions, including private persons and households, whose primary aim is not generation of profit but providing of non-market services to households. They include, e.g., associations of research organisations, associations, unions, societies, clubs, federations, movements, or foundations. The private non-profit sector is insignificant as for R&D performance.

Note – Year-on-year changes in data on research and development by sector of performance, type of workplace, ownership, or economic activity (industry) may be caused by reclassification of the surveyed entities, e.g. when there is a change in ownership, principal (prevailing) economic activity, legal form, or institutional sector.

Research and development activities are especially measured in the government sector and the higher education sector in the following six main fields of R&D (broad fields) defined according to an international classification called the Fields of Research and Development Classification (FORD classification):

– Natural sciences (Mathematics, Computer and information sciences; Physical sciences; Chemical sciences; Earth and related environmental sciences; Biological sciences; Other natural sciences);

– Engineering and technology (Civil engineering; Electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering; Mechanical engineering; Chemical engineering; Materials engineering; Medical engineering; Environmental engineering; Environmental biotechnology; Industrial biotechnology; Nano-technology; Other engineering and technologies);

– Medical and health sciences (Basic medicine; Clinical medicine; Health sciences; Medical biotechnology; Other medical science);

– Agricultural and veterinary sciences (Agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; Animal and dairy science; Veterinary science; Agricultural biotechnology; Other agricultural sciences);

– Social sciences (Psychology and cognitive sciences; Economics and business; Education; Sociology; Law; Political science; Social and economic geography; Media and communications; Other social sciences);

– Humanities and the arts (History and archaeology; Languages and literature; Philosophy, ethics and religion; Arts (arts, history of arts, performing arts, music); Other humanities).

Data on the R&D by main fields of R&D (broad fields) are based on the prevailing field of the surveyed R&D workplaces.

Research and development (R&D) personnel

Persons employed in research and development (hereinafter only referred to as R&D personnel) comprise researchers, technicians, administrators, and other supporting staff working at R&D workplaces in individual reporting units, who ensure direct services for those workplaces. The R&D personnel category includes all persons aged 15+ years paid in employment. The formal job attachment mainly refers to an employment contract, an agreement on work performance, and an agreement on work activity.

R&D personnel are broken down according to the work they perform (occupation) as follows:

– researchers, who are engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge, products, processes, methods, and systems or who manage such projects. They are mainly professionals and R&D managers;

– technicians and equivalent staff (hereinafter only referred to as technicians) who participate in R&D by performing scientific and technical tasks involving the application of concepts, operational methods and the use of research equipment, normally under the supervision of researchers;

– other supporting staff who are skilled and unskilled craftsmen, and administrative, secretarial, and clerical staff participating in R&D projects or directly associated with such projects; also included are managers, administrators, and clerical staff, activities of whom are a direct service to R&D.

The number of R&D personnel is surveyed by two main measurement units; they are the headcount and the full-time equivalent of R&D personnel (engaged in work on R&D activities equalling to one year of full-time work):

– headcount of R&D personnel refers to the registered number of persons fully or partially engaged in research and development activities, employed in the reporting units in main or secondary employment as at the end of the reference year. Primarily in the higher education sector and partially also in the government sector, a huge amount of R&D personnel, especially researchers, have an employment contract in more entities. Therefore, in these sectors, the indicator is overestimated and does not provide the real number of persons working in R&D;
[/X][P][X]
Věda, výzkum a inovace
Science, research, and innovation
– full-time equivalent (FTE) refers to the average registered number of R&D personnel converted to annual full-time workload devoted to R&D activities. One FTE equals one-year (full-time) work of a member of personnel who is 100% engaged in R&D activities. The FTE indicator also includes the number of persons working for the reporting unit under agreements on work performance and agreements on work activity converted according to the methodology valid for the FTE.

Research and development (R&D) expenditure
Research and development expenditure includes all current expenditure (wages and salaries and other current expenditure) and capital (investment) expenditure spent during the reference year on R&D performed in reporting units (intramural R&D) in the territory of a given country regardless of the source or the way of funding. Surveyed (intramural) R&D expenditure does not include extramural expenditure on R&D performed outside a reporting unit, sector, or country. The intramural R&D expenditure thus excludes expenditure spent on the purchase of external R&D from entities performing R&D, sources transferred to other experts within a common R&D project, and subsidies or contributions (financial transfers) provided to third persons for R&D performed at their place.

Total expenditure on R&D made in the territory of a given country is statistically measured by the indicator of the gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD). The indicator includes funds received from abroad (i.e. the “rest of the world”) for R&D performed in the territory of the given country; however, it excludes domestic funds provided for R&D performed abroad.

The amount of R&D expenditure made in sectors of performance is measured by the main sources of funding of R&D activities:
– funds from the business enterprise sector mainly comprising own (internal) sources of surveyed enterprises earmarked for R&D performed within these enterprises and sources of parent companies funding R&D in their foreign affiliations in the Czech Republic. As for the government sector and the higher education sector, funding from business enterprise sources mainly includes income from the sale of R&D services (orders for R&D) and income from royalties and license fees for intangible results of R&D;
– funds from the government sector – national that come from the state budget or budgets of Regions earmarked for R&D performed in the territory of the Czech Republic;
– funds from the government sector – from abroad, which especially include income from the European Structural Funds. They also include other sources from the EU budget and sources from international organizations outside the EU (CERN, ILL, NATO, UNO, WHO, Norway grants and EEA grants, etc.).

Besides the aforementioned main sources, also other national sources contribute to R&D funding, which mainly comprise own sources of universities and private non-profit institutions originating neither from the state budget, the business enterprise sector, nor from abroad. These sources are insignificant in the CR within the total R&D expenditure.

Tables 23-7 to 23-11 Government budget appropriations for R&D (GBARD)
Statistics of government budget appropriations for R&D (GBARD) is made with annual periodicity based on the Regulation (EU) 2019/2152 of the European Parliament and of the Council and on the methodology provided in the Frascati Manual (OECD, 2015). A list of socio-economic objectives is provided in the Nomenclature for the Analysis and Comparison of Scientific Programmes and Budgets (NABS, Eurostat 2007).

In the Czech Republic, statistics of government budget appropriations for R&D (GBARD) is compiled based on administrative data obtained from the Information system of research, development, and innovation. Data are also partially obtained directly from individual providers of public support of R&D. Statistics of direct government support of R&D takes into account terminology and specification of expenditure pursuant to the Act No 130/2002 Sb, on the Support of Research, Experimental Development, and Innovations from Public Funds (as amended).

Government budget appropriations for R&D (GBARD) include in the case of the Czech Republic all financial sources provided from the state budget to support R&D, including sources flowing to the R&D abroad. According to the valid international methodology, the government support of R&D excludes support of R&D via loans to be repaid, pre-financing of programmes of the EU covered by income from the European Union, and support of innovations.

All data on the government budget appropriations for R&D (GBARD) result from data provided in the State Final Account of the Czech Republic for the area of R&D. It applies to expenditure, which was really drawn for R&D from the state budget in the given year (not to amounts approved in the Act on the State Budget of the CR for the given year).

Table 23-12 Government tax relief for R&D expenditure (GTARD) in private enterprises
Government tax relief for R&D expenditure (GTARD) is applied deduction of expenditure on realization of R&D projects from income taxes of legal and natural persons. Data on the government tax relief for R&D expenditure (GTARD) have been surveyed by statisticians since 2007. Tax returns are the administrative data source. Only legal persons (enterprises) in institutional sectors S.11 Non-financial corporations and S.12 Financial corporations are surveyed. Information on natural persons (entrepreneurs) is not available.

Government tax relief for R&D expenditure (GTARD) is calculated based on the following formula: Government tax relief for R&D expenditure (GTARD) = applied deduction of expenditure on R&D from the tax base multiplied by the tax rate.

Science, research, and innovation
Deductions cannot be applied on services and intangible results of research and development (except for those purchased from public universities, public research institutions, and other research organisations mentioned in the Act No 130/2002 Sb, on the Support of Research, Experimental Development, and Innovations from Public Funds). A complete list of properties / eligible costs can be found in the instruction of the Ministry of Finance No MF-17.

Table 23-13 Patent licences
A licence is one of the possibilities to use industrial rights and intellectual property on a commercial basis. A licence agreement refers to granting of the right, in an agreed scope and in an agreed territory, for acquisition or provision of patented or non-patented inventions. The licensor entitles the licence acquirer to exercise industrial property rights in an agreed scope and in an agreed territory and the licence acquirer undertakes to provide some payments (licence fees) or another asset. By subject of a licence there are patent licences, the subject of which is to provide the right to use a valid patent either in the country of the acquirer (purchaser) or in countries, to which the acquirer of the licence intends to export the licence product, utility model licences, the subject of which is an industrial design or a utility model, know-how licences, the subject of which is to provide unprotected production and technical knowledge or experience.

The Czech Statistical Office has been surveying data on licences provided in the area of industrial property protection by the Annual questionnaire on licences. It is an exhaustive survey. In terms of dissemination of results of research and development and their capitalisation, the most important subjects of licence agreements are provided patent licences, on which the CZSO primarily focuses in its survey. All legal persons in the Czech Republic with a valid patent for the territory of the Czech Republic as at 31 December of the reference year have been reporting units in the survey on provided patent licences.

Data are available in the breakdown by sector (the business enterprise sector, the government sector, and the higher education sector) defined in accordance with the methodology of sectors of research and development performance (see definitions in the Notes on Tables 23-1 to 23-6 Research and development (R&D)).

Tables 23-14 to 23-16 Patent activity
A patent is a public deed issued by the relevant patent office, which provides legal protection to an invention for the period of up to 20 years (provided that maintenance fees are paid), namely in the territory for which it was issued by the office. Patent protection in the territory of the Czech Republic is ensured by the Industrial Property Office of the CR (IPO CR). Patents are granted for inventions, which are novelties, they are a result of activity of inventors, and are industrially applicable. The following can be patented: not only products and technologies, but also chemically produced substances, drugs, industrial production microorganisms, as well as microbiological ways and products obtained by those ways. What cannot be patented, on the contrary, are discoveries or scientific theories, programmes for computers, new cultivars of plants and breeds of animals or ways of surgical or therapeutic treatment of human or animal bodies, and diagnostic methods used at human or animal bodies.

Patent statistics brings information about results and successfulness of research, development, and innovation activity in selected areas of technology. Data in the Chapter were processed by the CZSO based on data sources of the IPO CR (Tables 23-14 and 23-15) and the World Intellectual Property Organization – WIPO (Table 23-16). A patent may be granted through the so-called national way, when an application is filed directly with the IPO CR. This option is mainly used by domestic applicants. The second option, which is chosen mainly by foreign applicants, is the validation of a patent, granted by the European Patent Office, for the territory of Czechia. This validation is carried out by the IPO CR after statutory conditions have been met. Patent data given in Tables 23-14 and 23-15 are classified using the so-called fractional method (e.g., if two applicants from different countries file together a patent application, a half of the patent is assigned to each country). Data in the Table 23-16 are broken down by country of the first mentioned applicant.

Tables 23-17 and 23-18 Innovating enterprises
Data on innovations contained in the Chapter are obtained based on a statistical survey on innovations in enterprises, which is carried out to map innovation potential of enterprises doing their business in the Czech Republic. The statistical survey fully respects methodological principles of the European Union (EU) and of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated in the Oslo Manual (OECD, 2018) and in the Regulation (EU) 2019/2152 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The statistical survey population includes reporting units of the business enterprise sector with 10+ employees in selected key economic activities according to the Classification of Economic Activities (CZ-NACE). The following are subjects of the statistical survey: product innovations and business process innovations. A product innovation is the introduction of a good or service that is new or improved on the market. Innovated products must significantly differ from those that have been previously placed by the enterprise on the market. It applies to products or services functional characteristics of which (e.g. technical specifications, components and materials used, software, and user friendliness) or intended usage of which significantly differs from the previous products of the enterprise. It also includes important changes in the design that changes technical, utility, or functional properties of the product.

Science, research, and innovation

Slight or small improvements, routine modernisation, seasonal changes (e.g. of clothes) or aesthetic changes in the design that do not change functional, technical, or utility properties of the product are not considered to be a product innovation. A business process innovation is the implementation of new or improved enterprise activities that significantly differ from those used by the enterprise in the past. Small or routine improvements that do not differ much from the previous ones as for changes, functions, and results are not considered to be a business process innovation.

Business process innovations include:
– Internal process innovation, i.e. implementation of (a) new or improved (way of):
– production or providing of services;
– logistic activities (e.g. supply/delivery, storage, manipulation with material or distribution);
– processing of enterprise information, internal communication, or provision thereof;
– accounting, finance (e.g. controlling), or other administrative activities.

Internal process innovations only include significant changes in used techniques, equipment, or software in order to enhance quality, efficiency, or flexibility of production, supply activities, and other auxiliary enterprise activities such as maintenance, purchase, accounting, ICT support, or reduction of a threat to (burden on) the environment or security risks.

– A marketing innovation, i.e. implementation of the following changes in marketing or sale:
– new product design to achieve a better aesthetic impression;
– new packaging or a method of packing products that significantly differs from the previous ones (e.g. a key change of the material used for packaging, a distinctively different product packaging look/design);
– a new way of promotion or advertising (e.g. utilizing of a new promotion channel such as social networks, internet advertising, building of a new brand, introduction of loyalty cards);
– new pricing strategy;
– new selling technique.

A marketing innovation is aimed at addressing customer needs better, entering new markets or finding a new place on the market, and at increasing the enterprise’s volume of sales. The distinguishing feature of a marketing innovation compared to other enterprise’s marketing instruments is the implementation of a marketing method not previously used by the enterprise.

– An organisational innovation, i.e. implementation of a new or improved way of organisation or management of:
– human resources;
– supplier-customer relations;
– other enterprise activities (e.g. quality management or flows of knowledge);
– cooperation with other entities (e.g. forming strategic alliances or industrial clusters);
– outsourcing of part of enterprise activities.

In case of organisational innovations, it is a major change of an organisational structure, management methods, or cooperation with other entities that have not been previously used by the enterprise, namely in order to enhance usage of knowledge, quality, or to enhance effectiveness of how activities are carried out.

Innovating enterprises are enterprises, which during the reporting period implemented at least one of the aforementioned innovations.

Tables 23-19 to 23-22 Expenditure on innovations and sales from innovations in enterprises

Total expenditure related to innovations in the surveyed period includes as follows: expenditure on in-house research and development, purchase of external research and development, acquisition of machinery, equipment, software, and buildings (hardware and software acquired in order to implement new or significantly improved products and/or processes), acquisition of or licensing intellectual property (royalties and licence fees paid or purchase of patents, utility and industrial models, production and technical knowledge and procedures, trademarks or copyrights from other entities in order to use them for company innovations) and expenditure on other innovation activities (design, training, introduction of innovations to the market, and other activities related to innovations made).

Total sales of enterprises with product innovation are sales of innovating enterprises, which introduced product innovation in the surveyed period. They are broken down to sales for innovated products (new to the market, new to the enterprise) and sales for unchanged or slightly modified products (products or services, at which the element of “novelty” is missing and they are not considered to be innovated).

In the tables 23-19 to 23-22 regarding expenditure on innovations and sales from innovations in enterprises, total expenditure related to innovations in the surveyed period includes various categories. The expenditure on in-house research and development was recorded, which is essential for fostering innovation within the enterprise. Additionally, the purchase of external research and development was included, indicating investment in outside expertise to enhance innovation capabilities.

The acquisition of machinery, equipment, software, and buildings was also part of the total expenditure, which is crucial for implementing new or significantly improved products and/or processes. This expenditure reflects the commitment of enterprises to upgrade their operational capabilities.

Furthermore, the acquisition of or licensing intellectual property was noted, which includes royalties and licence fees paid or the purchase of patents, utility and industrial models, production and technical knowledge and procedures, trademarks, or copyrights from other entities. This aspect is vital for enterprises to leverage existing innovations and enhance their product offerings.

Lastly, expenditure on other innovation activities was included, which encompasses design, training, introduction of innovations to the market, and other activities related to innovations made. This indicates a comprehensive approach to innovation that goes beyond mere product development.

Tables 23-23 and 23-24 Science and engineering professionals
Science and engineering professionals are a narrow group of experts. Within their work activities, they conduct research, improve or develop concepts, theories and operational methods, or apply scientific knowledge relating to fields such as physics, astronomy, meteorology, chemistry, geophysics, geology, biology, ecology, pharmacology, medicine, mathematics, statistics, architecture, engineering, design, and technology. Science and engineering professionals are defined since 2011 based upon the Classification of Occupations (CZ-ISCO) and contain the following minor groups of occupations of the CZ-ISCO sub-major group 21, which are sources of their main income: 211 Physical and earth science professionals; 212 Mathematicians, actuaries and statisticians; 213 Life science professionals; 214 Engineering professionals (excluding electrotechnology); 215 Electrotechnology engineers; 216 Architects, planners, surveyors and designers.

In the Table 23-23, data on persons working in the CZ-ISCO 211 and 212 occupations are reported together in the category of Physicists, chemists, mathematicians, statisticians and related professionals. Data on the numbers of science and engineering professionals (Table 23-23) come from the Labour Force Sample Survey (LFSS). In order to ensure higher reliability and to eliminate considerable year-on-year fluctuations of values for this group of employees, data in the table are provided as three-year moving averages (i.e., for example, the value for 2022 is calculated as an average from the values for 2021, 2022, and 2023). In 2023, a new weighing method was introduced within the LFSS. More detailed information on the LFSS can be found in the Chapter 10 Labour Market, Part B.

Data on wages of science and engineering professionals (Table 23-24) come from the structural employee wage statistics, which is generated by merging of databases of the sample survey of the Information System on Average Earnings of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, which covers the wage sphere, and of the administrative data source of the Salary Information System of the Ministry of Finance, which exhaustively covers the salary sphere. More detailed information on the structural employee wage statistics can be found in the Chapter 10 Labour Market, Part A, namely in notes on Tables 10-4 and 10-5.

Tables 23-25 and 23-26 Students of and graduates from science and engineering fields of education at universities
Education at universities presented in the table belongs to the tertiary level of education and includes a bachelor, follow-up master, master, and doctoral study programme. The follow-up master and master study programmes are given in tables together as master study programmes. Fields of education given in the table are defined based on the International Standard Classification of Education: Fields of Education and Training 2013 (ISCED-F 2013) as follows: Science fields of education correspond to the broad field of Natural sciences, mathematics and statistics (code 05) and Engineering fields of education correspond to the broad field of Engineering, manufacturing and construction (code 07). Numbers of students and graduates in tables are given as headcount, i.e. each student is included in a particular piece of data only once, including students, who study in more study programmes or more fields of education at the same time. The total numbers of students and graduates thus do not have to be equal to the sums of students and graduates of respective types of study programmes and groups of fields of education. The data were obtained from data sources of the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports, namely from the Union Information from Students’ Registers (the “SIMS”). The source database of SIMS is continually completed and updated, including retrospective corrections. Data published in this Yearbook correspond to the state of processing as at 30 January 2024. Data on students of universities are always related to 31 December of the relevant year; data on graduates are related to the entire school year.

Table 23-27 International trade in high-tech goods
Goods with high technology intensity (hereinafter only referred to as high-tech goods) mean products, production and processing of which require (in a large extent) top, technologically highly advanced, and intensive operations. Development of those products is usually accompanied by rather high costs for research, development, and innovation. Within international trade statistics (change of ownership), high-tech goods are defined by the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC). Eurostat elaborated a list of high-tech goods based on the fourth revision of the aforementioned classification (SITC Rev. 4) that became effective from 2007. According to the classification, high-tech goods are divided to nine main categories (aggregations).

Věda, výzkum a inovace
Science, research, and innovation
Data on exports and imports of high-tech goods are obtained from data outputs of the international trade statistics, which measures the real trade in goods carried out between Czech and foreign entities, i.e. a change of ownership between residents and non-residents.

Table 23-28 Technology balance of payments
Technology balance of payments monitors sale and purchase of intangible technologies of a given country in relation to other economies. Data on receipts (or payments) received within international trade in technology express technological level of an economy, i.e. they inform about the scope of international trade with industrial property and knowledge related to advanced technologies. Basic methodology and concept of technology balance of payments statistics, which comprises international trade in technology, is based on the Technology Balance of Payments Manual, OECD, 1990. Data on exports and imports of technology come from a direct survey of the CZSO on exports and imports of services. Individual TBP items are defined based on the Extended Balance of Payments Services Classification (EBOPS 2010) as follows: Computer services and software (codes: SI2 and SH3) – for more information see Chapter 22 Information Society. Architectural, engineering, scientific and other technical services (code SJ31), which include: – architectural services; – engineering services, which include the design, development and utilization of machines, materials, instruments, structures, processes and systems. Services of this type involve the provision of designs, plans and studies related to engineering projects; – scientific and other technical services include surveying; cartography; product testing and certification; and technical inspection services. Research and development (code SJ1), which includes provision of customised and non-customised research and development services, exchange and transfer of R&D funds are funds with or without a compensatory return flow of R&D and sale of proprietary rights arising from research and development (patents, copyrights arising from research and development, industrial processes and designs, other sales of proprietary rights arising from research and development). Royalties and licence fees (codes SH2 and SH42; hereinafter referred to as “licence fees”), which include received or paid licence fees for provided ownership right to temporarily use products arisen based on performed R&D activity (inventions, new technological solutions, new cultivars of plants and breeds of animals, new pieces of knowledge and know-how), i.e. income from authorised temporary use of subjects of industrial rights (e.g. patents, industrial and utility models), know-how, and other intangible results of R&D activity including trademarks and design.

Tables 23-29 and 23-30 Basic indicators of enterprises in high-tech sector
A group of industries with high technology intensity (hereinafter only referred to as high-technology sector or high-tech sector) is an aggregation of economic activities largely using highly advanced or top technologies and development of their outputs is often accompanied by high costs for innovation and/or research and development.

Metodické vysvětlivky
Tabulky 24-1 až 24-24 byly převzaty ze zdrojů rezortního pracoviště státní statistické služby Ministerstva školství, mládeže a tělovýchovy (MŠMT). Údaje o státních vysokých školách (Policejní akademie ČR v Praze a Univerzita obrany) přebírá MŠMT od Ministerstva vnitra a Ministerstva obrany, která je zřizují. Údaje v tabulce 24-25 pocházejí z Výběrového šetření pracovních sil (VŠPS), které v ČR zajišťuje ČSÚ, a sice se čtvrtletní periodicitou. Šetření probíhá ve všech členských státech Evropské unie. Podrobnější údaje o VŠPS lze získat v kapitole 10B Trh práce.

Poznámky k tabulkám
Data za předškolní až vyšší odborné vzdělávání jsou uváděna za školní roky, s výjimkou samostatných tabulek s počty učitelů a jejich průměrnou hrubou měsíční mzdou, ve kterých jsou údaje za kalendářní roky. Data za školní roky jsou vykazována podle stavu k 30. září, data za kalendářní roky zohledňují období celého roku. Data za vysoké školy jsou čerpána ze systému Sdružených informací matrik studentů (SIMS), kam veřejné i soukromé vysoké školy předávají údaje o studujících, poprvé zapsaných studentech a absolventech. Publikované údaje jsou v případě počtu studentů podle stavu k 31. prosinci daného roku; údaje o poprvé zapsaných studentech a absolventech za kalendářní rok. Zdrojová databáze SIMS je trvale doplňována a aktualizována, včetně zpětných oprav; údaje publikované v této ročence odpovídají stavu zpracování ke dni 20. ledna 2024.

Počty učitelů (tj. včetně ředitelů, jejich zástupců a výchovných poradců), resp. v případě vysokých škol profesorů, docentů a ostatního pedagogického personálu jsou přepočteny na plně zaměstnané. Děti/žáci/studenti mateřských až vyšších odborných škol a studenti státních vysokých škol jsou vykazováni v počtech studií (tj. je-li např. jeden žák/student zapsán ve více studijních programech či na více školách, započítává se do příslušného údaje vícekrát). Výjimkou je pouze dělení dle státního občanství, ve kterém jsou jako jednotky vedeny fyzické osoby. Na rozdíl od toho studenti veřejných a soukromých vysokých škol jsou vykazováni ve fyzických osobách (tj. jeden student, bez ohledu na to, kolik škol či programů studuje, je v každém z údajů započten jen jednou). Celkové počty studentů, absolventů a poprvé zapsaných do studia na veřejných a soukromých vysokých školách tak nemusejí souhlasit se součty za jednotlivé vysoké školy, případně jednotlivé formy studia a typy studijních programů.

Poprvé zapsanými studenty jsou studenti poprvé zapsaní do studia na vysoké škole spadající do vzdělávací soustavy České republiky, případně do dílčího studijního programu takové školy. To znamená, že např. student poprvé zapsaný do navazujícího magisterského studia je zároveň poprvé zapsaným na vysokou školu české vzdělávací soustavy jen tehdy, pokud bakalářský obor, na který navazuje, vystudoval na zahraniční vysoké škole.

Děti, resp. žáci a studenti se zdravotním postižením jsou děti/žáci/studenti s postižením mentálním, sluchovým, se závažnými vadami řeči, s postižením tělesným, s více vadami, se závažnými vývojovými poruchami učení a chování a s poruchami autistického spektra. Ti mohou být individuálně integrováni do běžných tříd, zařazeni do speciálních tříd na běžných školách, nebo navštěvovat školy zaměřené primárně na výuku žáků se speciálními vzdělávacími potřebami.

Za cizince jsou považovány děti, žáci a studenti, jejichž státní občanství je jiné než české. U dětí, žáků a studentů mateřských až vyšších odborných škol je zaznamenáno pouze jedno státní občanství uvedené při zápisu do školy, případně jeho poslední aktualizovaná podoba. U studentů vysokých škol veřejných a soukromých může být zaznamenáno více než jedno státní občanství.

Zřizovatelé škol, s výjimkou vysokých, se dělí na veřejné a neveřejné. Veřejným zřizovatelem může být MŠMT, obec či svazek obcí, kraj nebo jiný rezort státní správy. Neveřejnými zřizovateli škol jsou církev či privátní sektor. Vysoké školy se dle zřizovatele dělí na školy veřejné, soukromé a státní.

Tab. 24-1 a 24-2 Předškolní vzdělávání
Předškolní vzdělávání slouží k přípravě dětí pro vstup do povinné školní docházky. Pro děti, které dosáhnou do konce srpna pěti let, je předškolní vzdělávání od 1. září daného roku povinné, a to až do vstupu do první třídy základní školy. Kromě mateřských škol zajišťují předškolní vzdělávání přípravné třídy základní školy a přípravný stupeň základní školy speciální, obojí zřizované při základních školách. Přípravné třídy umožňují především vyrovnat vývoj těch dětí, které mají z jakéhokoliv důvodu udělený odklad povinné školní docházky. Přípravný stupeň základní školy speciální umožňuje nezbytnou přípravu na základní vzdělávání dětem se středně těžkým a těžkým mentálním postižením, se souběžným postižením více vadami nebo s autismem.

Tab. 24-3 a 24-4 Základní vzdělávání
Základní vzdělávání je součástí povinné školní docházky. Povinnou školní docházku zahajují podle zákona děti ve věku šesti let, v případě dětí s odkladem povinné školní docházky nejpozději ve věku osmi let. Povinná školní docházka trvá devět let, pět let na prvním stupni a čtyři roky na druhém stupni základních škol. Základní vzdělávání pro žáky se speciálními vzdělávacími potřebami, kteří se vzdělávají ve třídách nebo školách s upraveným vzdělávacím programem, případně ve

Vzdělávání
Education
Školách speciálních může s předchozím souhlasem MŠMT trvat deset ročníků; první stupeň je tvořen prvním až šestým ročníkem a druhý stupeň sedmým až desátým ročníkem. Žáci mohou základní školu opustit dříve a povinnou školní docházku dokončit v nižších ročnících víceletých gymnázií a v osmiletém oboru tanec na konzervatořích.

Tab. 24-5 až 24-10 Středoškolské vzdělávání
Středoškolské vzdělávání zahrnuje několik různých druhů vzdělávání nabízeného ve středních školách. Střední vzdělávání označuje (v denní formě) dvouleté vzdělávací programy ukončené závěrečnou zkouškou (bez získání výučního listu či maturitního vysvědčení). Střední vzdělávání s výučním listem označuje (v denní formě) dvouleté nebo tříleté vzdělávací programy, jejichž úspěšným ukončením absolvent získává výuční list. Střední vzdělávání s maturitní zkouškou označuje maturitní obory, ve kterých absolvent získává maturitní vysvědčení. Toto vzdělávání je realizováno ve dvou variantách:
– všeobecné, které má neprofesní charakter vzdělávání a je určeno pro přípravu na další studium. Jedná se o obory gymnázií. V současné době mají obory gymnázií dvojí podobu – čtyřletou, do které odcházejí absolventi základních škol po úspěšném dokončení 9. ročníku, a víceletou (osmiletou a šestiletou) pro žáky z nižších ročníků základních škol (z 5., resp. 7. ročníku);
– odborné, které má profesní charakter vzdělávání, je v délce čtyř let a ukončené maturitní zkouškou. Nástavbové studium trvá v denní formě dva roky a je zakončené maturitní zkouškou. Je určeno pro uchazeče, kteří získali střední vzdělání s výučním listem v délce tří let denní formy vzdělávání v oboru příbuzném tomu, v jakém chtějí složit maturitní zkoušku. Do středoškolského vzdělávání dále řadíme také zkrácené studium pro získání středního vzdělání s výučním listem. Toto studium, které v denní formě trvá jeden až dva roky, je určeno pro uchazeče, kteří získali střední vzdělání s maturitní zkouškou nebo střední vzdělání s výučním listem v jiném oboru vzdělání. Dále pak zkrácené studium pro získání středního vzdělání s maturitní zkouškou, které v denní formě trvá taktéž jeden až dva roky a je určené uchazečům, kteří získali střední vzdělání s maturitní zkouškou v jiném oboru.

Tab. 24-11 Konzervatoře
Kromě středních škol lze střední vzdělání s maturitní zkouškou v České republice získat též v konzervatořích, a sice nejdříve po čtyřech letech v denní formě šestiletého vzdělávacího programu (určeného pro absolventy základních škol), nebo po osmi letech v denní formě vzdělávání v osmiletém vzdělávacím programu v oboru tanec (v prvních čtyřech ročnících žáci plní povinnou školní docházku). Závěrečným vykonáním absolutoria v konzervatoři však žák získává vyšší odborné vzdělání na konzervatoři a je mu přiznán titul diplomovaný specialista (DiS.).

Tab. 24-12 Vyšší odborné školy
Vyšší odborné školy nabízejí absolventům středního vzdělávání s maturitní zkouškou denní formu vzdělávání ve tříletých oborech (u zdravotnických oborů včetně odborné praxe až třiapůlletých) a dálkovou formu vzdělávání v délce až čtyři roky. Vzdělávání je zakončeno absolutoriem a absolventům je přiznáván titul diplomovaný specialista (DiS.).

Tab. 24-13 až 24-16 Učitelé a asistenti pedagoga působící v regionálním školství a jejich průměrná hrubá měsíční mzda
V tabulkách 24-13 a 24-14 jsou uvedeny počty učitelů, resp. asistentů pedagoga k 30. 9. daného školního roku přepočtené na plně zaměstnané osoby. V tabulkách 24-15 a 24-16 jsou zaznamenány průměrné měsíční mzdy učitelů mateřských až vyšších odborných škol a asistentů pedagoga v kalendářních rocích, a sice bez ostatních osobních nákladů (OON) a ostatních plateb za provedenou práci (OPPP). Mezi učitele jsou zahrnuti i ředitelé, zástupci ředitelů a výchovní poradci.

Tab. 24-17 Veřejné výdaje na školství
Údaje o veřejných výdajích na školství jsou převzaty z ročenky MŠMT. Jejich zdrojem je specializovaný informační portál Ministerstva financí MONITOR (viz monitor.statnipokladna.cz). Data jsou vykazována za kalendářní roky a jedná se o celkové výdaje na vzdělávání a školské služby – Oddíl 31 a 32 odvětvového třídění rozpočtové skladby po konsolidaci na úrovni územních rozpočtů a státního rozpočtu v běžných cenách. Školská zařízení pro výkon ústavní a ochranné výchovy jsou určena zpravidla dětem a mládeži ve věku 3–18 let, kterým umožňují ochranu před nepříznivým působením nefunkčního rodinného nebo jiného sociálně nepříznivého prostředí. Zahrnují diagnostický ústav, dětský domov, dětský domov se školou a výchovný ústav.

Methodological notes
Tables 24-1 to 24-24 were obtained from sources of a workplace of the State Statistical Service at the Ministry of Education,
Youth, and Sports. The Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports receives data on state universities (the Police Academy of
the Czech Republic in Prague and the University of Defence) from the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence,
respectively, which are founders of the universities.
Data in the Table 24-25 are taken from the Labour Force Sample Survey (LFSS), which is carried out in the Czech Republic
by the CZSO, namely with quarterly periodicity. The survey is carried out in all Member States of the European Union. More
detailed information on the LFSS can be found in the Chapter 10B Labour Market.
Notes on Tables
Data on early childhood education up to short-cycle tertiary education are given for school years, except for separate tables
with the numbers of teachers and their average gross monthly wages, which show data for calendar years. Data for school
years are reported with the status as at 30 September, data for calendar years take into account the whole year period. Data
on universities are taken from the SIMS database (i.e. Union Information from Students’ Registers), to which the universities,
both public and private, transmit data on students, students enrolled for the first time, and graduates. As for the number of
students, the published data are as at 31 December of a given year; the data for students enrolled for the first time and for
graduates are for the calendar year. The source SIMS database is continually completed and updated including retrospective
corrections; the data presented in this Statistical Yearbook refer to the database status as at 20 January 2024.
The numbers of teachers (i.e. including headmasters, their deputies, and guidance counsellors) or in the case of universities
professors, readers, and other teaching staff are converted to full-time equivalent persons.
Children/pupils/students in nursery schools up to higher professional schools and students in state universities are reported as
numbers of studies (i.e., for example, when a pupil/student is enrolled in multiple study programmes or in multiple schools, he
or she is counted multiple times in the relevant piece of data). The only exception is breakdown by citizenship, in which the
units kept are natural persons (headcount). On the contrary, students in public and private universities are reported as
headcount (i.e. one student is only counted once in each piece of data regardless how many schools or how many programmes
he or she is studying in). The total numbers of students, graduates, and the enrolled for the first time in studies at public and
private universities thus may differ from the sums for individual universities or individual types of education (studies) and types
of study programmes.
Students enrolled for the first time are students enrolled for the first time in studies at a university that falls under the education
system of the Czech Republic or in a partial study programme of such a school. It means that, for example, a student enrolled
for the first time in a follow-up master study programme is concurrently enrolled for the first time at a university of the Czech
education system only provided that he or she graduated from a bachelor study programme, which it follows, at a university
abroad.
Children or pupils and students with disabilities are children/pupils/students with a mental handicap or disability, with hearing
impairment, with severe speech impediments, with physical disability, with multiple handicaps/disabilities, with severe
developmental learning disabilities and developmental behaviour disorders, and with autistic spectrum disorders. They can be
individually integrated within common classes, included in special classes in regular schools, or attend schools focusing
primarily on education of pupils with special education needs.
Those children, pupils, and students are deemed to be foreigners whose state citizenship is other than Czech. Only a single
citizenship is recorded for children, pupils, and students of nursery schools up to higher professional schools; it is the one,
which was stated during their enrolment in school or its most recently updated version. For students of public and private
universities, more than one citizenship can be recorded.
Founders of schools (except for universities) are public or non-public. Public founders are, for example, the Ministry of
Education, Youth, and Sports, a municipality or a union of municipalities, a Region, or another institution of the state
administration. Non-public founders of schools are a church or the private sector. Universities by founder are: public, private,
and state ones.
Tables 24-1 and 24-2 Early childhood education
Early childhood education prepares children for their entry into compulsory school education. For children who have reached
five years of age by the end of August, the early childhood education is compulsory from 1 September of the given year, namely
until they enter the first grade of a basic school. Besides nursery schools, early childhood education is provided by preparatory
classes of basic schools and a preparatory stage of special basic schools, both founded at basic schools. Preparatory classes
mainly enable children with postponed compulsory school education due to whatever reason to catch up their development
with others. A preparatory stage of special basic schools enables to perform necessary preparations for primary education
to children suffering from moderate and severe mental retardation, multiple handicaps, or autism.

Tabulky 24-3 a 24-4 Základní vzdělání
Základní vzdělání je součástí povinného školního vzdělávání. Podle zákona začínají děti ve věku šesti let (nebo osmi let maximálně v případech dětí s odloženou povinností školní docházky) povinné školní vzdělávání. Povinné školní vzdělávání trvá devět let: pět let na prvním stupni a čtyři roky na druhém stupni základních škol. Základní vzdělání pro žáky se speciálními vzdělávacími potřebami, kteří studují v třídách nebo školách s upraveným vzdělávacím programem, nebo ve speciálních školách, může trvat deset ročníků se souhlasem Ministerstva školství, mládeže a tělovýchovy; první stupeň se skládá z prvního až šestého ročníku a druhý stupeň ze sedmého až desátého ročníku. Žáci mohou opustit základní školu dříve a dokončit své povinné školní vzdělávání v nižších ročnících víceletých gymnázií a v osmiletém specializovaném tanci na konzervatořích.

Tabulky 24-5 až 24-10 Střední vzdělání
Střední vzdělání se skládá z několika různých typů vzdělání nabízeného středními školami. Střední vzdělání označuje (při prezenčním studiu) dvouleté vzdělávací programy ukončené závěrečnou zkouškou (není získán výuční list ani maturitní vysvědčení). Střední vzdělání s výučním listem označuje (při prezenčním studiu) dvouleté nebo tříleté vzdělávací programy, jejichž úspěšným dokončením absolvent získává výuční list. Střední vzdělání s maturitní zkouškou označuje vzdělávací programy s maturitní zkouškou, jejichž absolventi získávají maturitní vysvědčení. Existují dva základní typy programů:
– všeobecné vzdělání, což je nevzdělávací (nespecializovaný) typ vzdělání určený k přípravě na další studium. Tyto programy poskytují gymnázia. V současnosti existují dva typy: čtyřleté programy gymnázií, které se připojují k základním školám po úspěšném dokončení devátého ročníku základních škol, a víceleté programy gymnázií (osmileté nebo šestileté programy gymnázií) pro žáky nižších ročníků základních škol (od pátého a sedmého ročníku, respektive);
– technické vzdělání, které se soustředí na profesní stránku vzdělání, trvá čtyři roky a končí maturitní zkouškou. Následné kurzy trvají při prezenčním studiu dva roky a končí maturitní zkouškou. Jsou určeny pro uchazeče, kteří získali střední vzdělání s výučním listem z tříletého prezenčního studia v oboru, který souvisí s tím, z něhož chtějí vykonat maturitní zkoušku.

Střední vzdělání také zahrnuje zkrácené studium k získání středního vzdělání s výučním listem. Tato studia, která trvají jeden až dva roky jako prezenční studium, jsou určena pro uchazeče, kteří získali střední vzdělání s maturitní zkouškou nebo střední vzdělání s výučním listem z jiného oboru vzdělání. Dále existují zkrácené studia k získání středního vzdělání s maturitní zkouškou, která jsou také jeden až dva roky dlouhá jako prezenční studium a jsou určena pro uchazeče, kteří získali střední vzdělání s maturitní zkouškou v jiném oboru vzdělání.

Tabulka 24-11 Konzervatoře
Kromě středních škol lze v České republice získat střední vzdělání s maturitní zkouškou také na konzervatořích, a to nejdříve po čtyřech letech prezenčního studia šestiměsíčního vzdělávacího programu (určeného pro absolventy základních škol), nebo po osmi letech prezenčního studia v osmiletém vzdělávacím programu ve specializaci tance (v prvních čtyřech ročnících žáci navštěvují své povinné školní vzdělávání). Nicméně, složením závěrečné (absolventské) zkoušky nazývané „absolutorium“ na konzervatoři získává žák krátký cyklus terciárního vzdělání na konzervatoři a získává titul „certifikovaný specialista“ (diplomovaný specialista, DiS.).

Tabulka 24-12 Vyšší odborné školy
Vyšší odborné školy nabízejí absolventům středních škol s maturitní zkouškou prezenční studium v tříletých oborech (v případě zdravotnických oborů včetně praktického výcviku trvajícího až tři a půl roku) a distanční studium trvající až čtyři roky. Tento typ vzdělání je ukončen složením závěrečné (absolventské) zkoušky nazývané „absolutorium“ a absolventi získávají titul „certifikovaný specialista“ (diplomovaný specialista, DiS.).

Tabulky 24-13 až 24-16 Učitelé a asistenti učitelů v regionálním vzdělávání a jejich průměrné hrubé měsíční mzdy
Tabulky 24-13 a 24-14 uvádějí počty učitelů a asistentů učitelů k 30. září daného školního roku převedené na plně zaměstnané osoby. Tabulky 24-15 a 24-16 ukazují průměrné měsíční mzdy učitelů mateřských škol až vyšších odborných škol a asistentů učitelů v kalendářních letech, a to bez dalších osobních nákladů a dalších plateb za vykonanou práci. Učitelé zahrnují také ředitele, jejich zástupce a výchovné poradce.

Metodické vysvětlivky
Údaje o zdravotním stavu obyvatelstva a o činnosti poskytovatelů zdravotních služeb jsou čerpány z Národního zdravotnického informačního systému (dále jen NZIS). NZIS je definován v zákoně o zdravotních službách a podmínkách jejich poskytování. NZIS je určený k vedení národních zdravotních registrů a zpracování údajů v nich vedených. Na základě pověření Ministerstva zdravotnictví spravuje NZIS Ústav zdravotnických informací a statistiky České republiky (ÚZIS ČR). Informace o výdajích na zdravotní péči podle systému zdravotnických účtů vycházejí z údajů Ministerstva zdravotnictví, Ministerstva financí, Ministerstva práce a sociálních věcí, Národního registru hrazených zdravotních služeb (NRHZS), který je součástí NZIS, a datových zdrojů ČSÚ. V kapitole je využíváno členění nemocí a přidružených zdravotních problémů podle diagnóz a kapitol 10. revize Mezinárodní statistické klasifikace nemocí a přidružených zdravotních problémů (MKN-10). Kromě výše uvedených zdrojů využívá tato kapitola Strukturální mzdovou statistiku, a to v případě údajů o průměrné hrubé měsíční mzdě lékařů a zdravotních sester. Údaje za studenty a absolventy zdravotní péče vysokých škol v Česku byly získány z datových zdrojů Ministerstva školství, mládeže a tělovýchovy, konkrétně ze systému Sdružených informací matrik studentů (SIMS).

Tab. 25-2 až 25-4 Lůžková péče v nemocnicích poskytujících akutní péči
Případy hospitalizace
Statistika hospitalizací vychází z jednotlivých hlášení o ukončených případech hospitalizace. Zpravodajskou jednotkou je každé lůžkové oddělení zdravotnických zařízení v ČR vyjma ozdravoven a lázeňských léčeben. Za jeden případ hospitalizace se považuje každé ukončení hospitalizace na jednom oddělení, ať již hospitalizace skončila propuštěním, nebo úmrtím pacienta či jeho přeložením na jiné oddělení nebo do jiného zařízení. Hospitalizovaní Počet osob (každá zahrnuta jen jednou) hospitalizovaných v daném zdravotnickém zařízení nebo na daném oddělení, včetně cizinců a narozených dětí. Ošetřovací dny Jedním ošetřovacím dnem rozumíme celý kalendářní den, za který se pacientovi dostalo všech služeb, které poskytovatel lůžkové péče poskytuje, tj. včetně ubytování a stravování.

Tab. 25-5 až 25-6 Lůžková péče v nemocnicích následné péče
Nemocnice následné péče – jedná se o zařízení, které poskytuje péči pacientovi, u kterého byla stanovena základní diagnóza a došlo ke stabilizaci jeho zdravotního stavu, zvládnutí náhlé nemoci nebo náhlého zhoršení chronické nemoci. Zdravotní stav pacienta však vyžaduje doléčení nebo poskytnutí zejména léčebně rehabilitační péče. Rovněž může být poskytována následná intenzivní péče pacientům, kteří jsou částečně nebo zcela závislí na podpoře základních životních funkcí.

Tab. 25-7 až 25-8 Lůžková péče v psychiatrických nemocnicích a léčebnách
Psychiatrická nemocnice (léčebna) – je lékařské zařízení se specializací na léčbu závažných duševních onemocnění a toxikomanických závislostí hospitalizovaných pacientů. Jedná se o zařízení poskytující dlouhodobou psychiatrickou péči, nikoli akutní.

Tab. 25-9 Lázeňské léčebny
Zdrojem informací je výkaz o činnosti poskytovatele lázeňské léčebně rehabilitační péče, vyplňovaný lázeňskými zařízeními. Lázeňská péče doporučená lékařem jako nezbytná součást léčebného procesu a plně hrazená zdravotní pojišťovnou se označuje jako komplexní lázeňská péče (KLP). Údaje o počtu zařízení a lůžek pro komplexní lázeňskou péči zahrnují rovněž zařízení, která v průběhu roku ukončila svou činnost.

Tab. 25-10 Vybrané infekční nemoci povinně hlášené

Zdraví
Health
Do celkových výdajů na zdravotní péči jsou v rámci systému zdravotnických účtů zahrnuty pouze běžné náklady. Ze sledovaných výdajů jsou vyloučeny následující položky financované přímo ze státního rozpočtu:
i)      výdaje na výstavbu a rekonstrukci zdravotnických zařízení,
ii)     investiční výdaje do nákupu a modernizace přístrojového vybavení,
iii)    výdaje na zdravotnický výzkum a vývoj,
iv)     výdaje na vzdělávání zdravotnického personálu.
Výdaje zdravotních pojišťoven zahrnují úhrady z povinného veřejného zdravotního pojištění na zdravotní péči vykázanou zdravotnickými zařízeními a uznanou zdravotními pojišťovnami. Příjmy zdravotních pojišťoven plynou z veřejného zdravotního pojištění, kterého je povinně účastna každá osoba s trvalým pobytem na našem území.
Výdaje ze státního rozpočtu zahrnují především podporu zařízení dlouhodobé péče (např. domovy pro seniory). Ze státního rozpočtu je hrazena i správa rezortu zdravotnictví, tj. provoz Ministerstva zdravotnictví, odborů zdravotnictví jednotlivých krajských úřadů, hygienických stanic, Státního zdravotního ústavu, Státního ústavu pro kontrolu léčiv a Ústavu zdravotnických informací a statistiky ČR. V roce 2020 bylo ze státního rozpočtu hrazeno oddlužení nemocnic a nákup ochranných prostředků v souvislosti s pandemií onemocnění covid-19.
Krajské a obecní rozpočty zahrnují finanční prostředky na zdravotní péči z rozpočtů krajů a obcí a týkají se například provozu zdravotnické záchranné služby.
Přímé výdaje domácností zahrnují přímé výdaje příjemců zdravotní péče (pacientů) nebo jejich případnou spoluúčast. Patří sem výdaje obyvatelstva za léky (doplatky u předepsaných léčiv a platby plných cen u volně prodejných léků), za prostředky zdravotnické techniky, platby za nadstandardní služby u stomatologů, za lázeňské pobyty, nadstandardně vybavené pokoje v nemocnicích a platby za různá potvrzení.
Dobrovolné zdravotní pojištění zahrnuje pouze cestovní pojištění. Obyvatelé Česka nemohou k hrazení zdravotní péče s výjimkou cestovního připojištění využívat jiné dobrovolné zdravotní připojištění.
Neziskové organizace zahrnují výdaje na zdravotní péči hrazené neziskovými nestátními institucemi (například Červený kříž). Činnost těchto institucí je financována z dobrovolných příspěvků domácností a z vládních transferů či dotací.
Závodní preventivní péče zahrnuje náklady na uskutečněné preventivní prohlídky a zdravotní vyšetření vlastních zaměstnanců, pokud nebyly hrazené z veřejného zdravotního pojištění.
Léčebná péče je souhrnem zdravotnických služeb pacientům zahrnujících zejména stanovení diagnózy, provedení odpovídajících vyšetření, stanovení postupu léčby nemoci (odstranění bolesti a potíží), provádění léčby potřebnými postupy včetně využití léků a odpovídajících zdravotnických výrobků a následné sledování zdravotního stavu.
Lůžková léčebná péče zahrnuje formální přijetí do zdravotnického zařízení k léčení, rehabilitaci nebo dlouhodobé péči, u které se předpokládá přenocování. Lůžková péče není omezena typem poskytovatele. Nejčastěji jím může být nemocnice, ale i zařízení ošetřovatelské péče nebo zařízení klasifikovaná jako poskytovatelé ambulantní péče, která poskytují příležitostné procedury vyžadující lůžkovou péči, a jsou tudíž schopna poskytnout ubytování přes noc.
Ambulantní léčebná péče zahrnuje lékařské a doplňkové služby poskytované pacientovi, který není formálně přijat do zařízení a nezůstává v něm přes noc. Ambulantní péče může být poskytována v nemocnicích nebo praktickými lékaři a specialisty v soukromých zdravotnických zařízeních či jednotlivých ordinacích.
Denní léčebná péče zahrnuje plánované výkony lékařů a nelékařského zdravotnického personálu poskytnuté pacientům, kteří byli formálně přijati do zdravotnického zařízení za účelem určení diagnózy, léčení či dalších druhů zdravotní péče. Pacient je přijat a propuštěn v ten samý den.
Domácí léčebná péče zahrnuje lékařské, doplňkové a pečovatelské služby, které jsou poskytovány pacientům v jejich domovech a zahrnují fyzickou přítomnost poskytovatele. Zahrnuty jsou porodnické služby doma, domácí dialýza a všechny ostatní služby zdravotní péče spotřebovávané v domácím prostředí bez ohledu na poskytovatele. Do této kategorie nepatří domovy s pečovatelskou službou.
Rehabilitační péče je souhrnem zdravotnických služeb prováděných v zařízeních rehabilitační péče (včetně lázeňských) zaměřených na odstranění zdravotních omezení a potíží pociťovaných pacientem a opětovné docílení odpovídajícího zdravotního stavu (obvykle po provedené léčebné péči).
Dlouhodobá zdravotní péče sestává ze škály služeb lékařské a osobní péče, které jsou spotřebovávány s prvotním cílem ulevit od bolesti a utrpení a zmenšit nebo zvládnout zhoršení zdravotního stavu pacientů se stupněm dlouhodobé závislosti.
Doplňkové služby zahrnují laboratorní a zobrazovací diagnostiku (RTG, CT, magnetická rezonance apod.) a také dopravu pacientů (jedná se i o zdravotnickou záchrannou službu).
Léky a zdravotnické prostředky jsou určené pro použití při diagnostice, zmírňování nebo léčbě onemocnění včetně předepsaných léků a volně prodejných léků. Nezahrnuje výdaje na léky spotřebované přímo v lůžkových zdravotnických zařízeních.
Preventivní péče zahrnuje imunizační programy (očkování), programy na včasné odhalení nemoci (např. screeningy zhoubných nádorů), pravidelné preventivní prohlídky (např. prohlídky v době těhotenství, růstu a vývoje dětí, zubní a všeobecné preventivní prohlídky). Mezi preventivní péči se řadí i výdaje za informační a poradenské programy, jako jsou

Informace o zdravotních důsledcích kouření, pití alkoholu, špatného stravování nebo nedostatečné fyzické aktivity. V roce 2020 a 2021 jsou v této kategorii zahrnuty i náklady na PCR a antigenní testování na onemocnění covid-19. Správa systému zdravotní péče se zaměřuje na systém zdravotnictví spíše než na přímou zdravotní péči a je považována za kolektivní službu, protože není alokována ke konkrétním jedincům, ale mají z ní užitek všichni uživatelé systému zdravotnictví. Řídí a podporuje fungování systému zdravotnictví. Od těchto služeb se očekává, že budou spravovat a zvyšovat účinnost a výkonnost systému zdravotnictví. Patří sem například formulace a správa vládní politiky, nastavování standardů, nebo licencování.

Tab. 25-18 Výdaje zdravotních pojišťoven na 1 obyvatele podle pohlaví a věkových skupin
Údaje v tabulce vycházejí ze systému zdravotnických účtů České republiky. Do celkového ukazatele výdajů na jednoho obyvatele daného pohlaví jsou započítávány i výdaje, které nelze rozdělit podle věku.

Tab. 25-19 Výdaje zdravotních pojišťoven podle vybraných diagnóz, pohlaví a věkových skupin
V tabulce jsou vybrány diagnózy, respektive kapitoly MKN-10, které pro zdravotní pojišťovny představují největší výdajové skupiny.

Tab. 25-20 Výdaje domácností na zdravotní péči
Základním zdrojem údajů pro odhad výdajů na konečnou spotřebu domácností na zdravotní péči jsou údaje ze statistiky národních účtů ČSÚ. Výdaje domácností na zdravotní péči jsou členěny podle mezinárodní metodiky systému zdravotnických účtů (SHA). V roce 2024 došlo k revizi Národních účtů a ČSÚ publikoval i zpětně údaje za výdaje domácností v členění podle nové klasifikace individuální spotřeby podle účelu (COICOP-2018). V souvislosti s touto revizí došlo jak k revizi celkových výdajů domácností na zdravotní péči, tak k revizi jednotlivých položek druhů poskytované zdravotní péče. Klasifikace COICOP-2018 totiž nabízí detailnější členění než předchozí klasifikace. Ostatní zdravotnický materiál a výrobky zahrnují zdravotnické zboží krátkodobé spotřeby (např. adhezivní náplast i neadhezivní obvazy, podkožní injekční stříkačky, lékárničky, zdravotnické punčochové zboží jako kompresní punčochy a bandáže na koleno apod.). Terapeutické pomůcky zahrnují širokou škálu přístrojů lékařské techniky od sluchadel přes invalidní vozíky (elektrické a mechanické) a vozítka pro invalidy, ale i různé zdravotnické zboží dlouhodobé spotřeby jinde neklasifikované jako např. přístroje na měření krevního tlaku.

Tab. 25-21 Smrtelné pracovní úrazy a nemoci z povolání
Smrtelný pracovní úraz je takové poškození zdraví při plnění pracovních úkolů nebo v přímé souvislosti s nimi, na jehož následky úrazem postižený zaměstnanec nejpozději do jednoho roku zemřel. Zdrojem dat je Státní úřad inspekce práce (SÚIP). Nemoci z povolání jsou podle § 1 odst. (1) Nařízení vlády č. 290/1995 Sb., kterým se stanoví seznam nemocí z povolání, ve znění pozdějších předpisů, nemoci vznikající nepříznivým působením chemických, fyzikálních, biologických nebo jiných škodlivých vlivů, pokud vznikly za podmínek uvedených v Seznamu nemocí z povolání. Nemocí z povolání se rozumí též akutní otrava vznikající nepříznivým působením chemických látek. Výrazný růstový zlom ve vývoji celkového počtu uznaných případů nemocí z povolání v ČR byl způsoben uznáním nemoci covid-19 jako nemoci z povolání pod novými evidenčními kódy. Ohrožení nemocí z povolání se podle § 347 zákona č. 262/2006 Sb., Zákoník práce, rozumí takové změny zdravotního stavu, jež vznikly při výkonu práce nepříznivým působením podmínek, za nichž vznikají nemoci z povolání, avšak nedosahují takového stupně poškození zdravotního stavu, který lze posoudit jako nemoc z povolání, a další výkon práce za stejných podmínek by vedl ke vzniku nemoci z povolání. Nemoci z povolání a ohrožení nemocí z povolání se evidují v Národním registru nemocí z povolání, který je součástí Národního zdravotnického informačního systému podle Zákona č. 372/2011 Sb., o zdravotních službách. Správcem Registru je ÚZIS ČR, zpracovatelem je Státní zdravotní ústav – Centrum hygieny práce a pracovního lékařství.

Tab. 25-22 Pracovníci ve zdravotnictví
Zdrojem dat je Národní registr zdravotnických pracovníků (NRZP), kategorie „ostatní pracovníci ve zdravotnictví“ je dopočtena z výkazu E(MZ)4-01. Zubní lékaři – provádějí prevenci, stanovují diagnózu, léčí onemocnění, zranění a malformace chrupu, úst, čelistí a souvisejících tkání. Používají různé specializované diagnostické, chirurgické a jiné metody na podporu a obnovu ústního zdraví. Farmaceuti – skladují, uchovávají, připravují a vydávají léčivé produkty v souladu s lékařskými předpisy a poskytují poradenství o správném užívání a nepříznivých vedlejších účincích léčiv. Přispívají k výzkumu, přípravě, předepisování a monitorování léčivých terapií pro optimalizaci lidského zdraví.

Tab. 25-23 a 25-24 Mzdy zdravotnických pracovníků v lůžkových zdravotnických zařízeních
Pro vymezení vybraných skupin zdravotnických pracovníků byla využita Klasifikace zaměstnání (CZ-ISCO). Prostřednictvím této klasifikace byly vybrány následující dvě kategorie zaměstnanců ve zdravotnictví:
221 Lékaři (kromě zubních lékařů);
222+322 Všeobecné sestry a porodní asistentky, které se dále člení na:
222 Všeobecné sestry a porodní asistentky se specializací;
322 Všeobecné sestry a porodní asistentky bez specializace.
Rozdíl mezi všeobecnými sestrami a porodními asistentkami se specializací a mezi všeobecnými sestrami a porodními asistentkami bez specializace by měl stanovit charakter vykonávané práce. Dokladem o specializované způsobilosti je diplom o specializaci v příslušném oboru, který zdravotní sestra získá na základě složení atestační zkoušky před oborovou atestační komisí. Mezi všeobecné sestry a porodní asistentky se specializací se řadí například staniční sestry, sestry a porodní asistentky pro intenzivní a perioperační péči a dále např. sestry pro pediatrii, interní a chirurgické obory. Sestry bez specializace zahrnují sestry praktických a zubních lékařů a dalších ambulantních specialistů. Kromě těchto kategorií sester ve zdravotnictví působí i vrchní sestry (ISCO 13424) a praktické sestry (ISCO 3256), které nejsou součástí výše uvedených všeobecných sester.
Data za mzdy lékařů (tab. 25-23) a všeobecných sester a porodních asistentek (tab. 25-24) v lůžkových zdravotnických zařízeních pocházejí ze strukturální mzdové statistiky zaměstnanců. Strukturální mzdová statistika vzniká sloučením údajů z Informačního systému o průměrném výdělku Ministerstva práce a sociálních věcí, který na základě výběrového souboru pokrývá mzdovou sféru, a z Informací a statistik o platu a služebním příjmu Ministerstva financí, který plošně pokrývá platovou sféru.
Lůžková zdravotnická zařízení jsou všechna zařízení poskytující akutní, následnou, dlouhodobou nebo psychiatrickou lůžkovou péči zařazená dle Klasifikace ekonomických činností (CZ-NACE) podle hlavní činnosti do skupiny 86.1. Jedná se především o nemocnice včetně specializovaných nemocnic (např. psychiatrické nebo porodnice), ale patří sem i léčebny nebo rehabilitační ústavy.
Zahrnuty jsou údaje o mzdách lékařů, zdravotních sester a porodních asistentek zaměstnaných v těchto zařízeních i v případech, kdy pracují pouze v jejich ambulantní části.
Do mzdové sféry spadají všechna soukromá zdravotnická zařízení, a to včetně krajských a městských nemocnic (akciové společnosti).
Do platové sféry se zařazují zdravotnická zařízení přímo řízená ministerstvem zdravotnictví (např. fakultní nemocnice a specializované zdravotnické ústavy) nebo příspěvkové organizace krajů.
Tab. 25-25 Studenti a absolventi oborů zdravotní péče na vysokých školách
Údaje za studenty a absolventy zdravotní péče byly získány ze systému Sdružených informací matrik studentů (SIMS).
Zdrojová databáze SIMS je trvale doplňována a aktualizována, včetně zpětných oprav; údaje publikované v této publikaci odpovídají stavu zpracování ke dni 20. ledna 2024. Data za studenty vysokých škol se vztahují vždy k 31. prosinci příslušného roku, data za absolventy pak k celému kalendářnímu roku.
Studium zdravotní péče je vymezeno na základě Klasifikace oborů vzdělání CZ-ISCED-F 2013, a to pomocí úzce vymezeného oboru 091 Zdravotní péče zahrnující následující podrobně vymezené obory vzdělání:
Stomatologie (0911);
Humánní medicína (0912) – skládá se zejména z přípravy lékařů;
Ošetřovatelství a porodní asistentství (0913);
Lékařská diagnostika a léčebné techniky (0914);

Počty studentů a absolventů jsou uvedeny ve fyzických osobách, tj. každý student je v konkrétním údaji zahrnut jen jednou, včetně studentů, kteří současně studují ve více studijních programech. Celkové počty studentů a absolventů tedy nemusí souhlasit se součtem studentů a absolventů jednotlivých typů studijních programů.
