Vážené čtenářky, vážení čtenáři, otevíráte již 32. vydání Statistické ročenky v novodobé historii České republiky. Její historie samozřejmě sahá mnohem hlouběji a navazuje na všechny dříve vydávané ročenky z doby československé. Tvoří tak ucelenou řadu publikací, které přinášejí na jednom místě nejpodstatnější informace ze všech důležitých oblastí života naší země a jejích obyvatel. Ačkoli dnes ve statistice využíváme řadu moderních nástrojů, jako jsou webové aplikace, on-line databáze, otevřená data či geoportály, význam Statistické ročenky trvá. A to i přesto, že počet tištěných výtisků se postupně snižuje a uživateli je stále více využívána její elektronická verze.

Aktuální ročenka popisuje primárně jevy, které se odehrály v roce 2023. Jaký tedy tento rok byl? Na konci roku 2023 mělo Česko poprvé od konce druhé světové války více než 10,9 milionu obyvatel a přírůstek stěhováním (94,7 tisíce osob) byl, po přírůstku v roce 2022, druhým nejvyšším v poválečné historii Česka. V migračním saldu převládali občané Ukrajiny (75,2 tis.), následováni občany Slovenska (5,6 tis.) a vůbec poprvé byli na třetím místě Filipínci (2,1 tis.). Rok 2023 se dále vyznačoval výrazným dvanáctiprocentním poklesem počtu sňatků. Poprvé od roku 2005 se živě narodilo méně než 100 tisíc dětí (91,1 tis.). Naděje dožití při narození již druhým rokem rostla a navázala tak na pozitivní vývoj před pandemií onemocněním covid-19.

Česká ekonomika se v roce 2023 potýkala s kombinací vlivu rostoucí zahraniční poptávky, domácí investiční aktivity a vládní spotřeby na jedné straně a pokračujícího propadu spotřeby domácností a negativního působení změny zásob na straně druhé. Výsledkem tohoto mixu bylo kolísání ekonomiky v pásmu stagnace, celkově hrubý domácí produkt (HDP) loni klesl o 0,1 %. Spotřebitelské ceny se zvýšily o 10,7 % (v roce 2022 to bylo o 15,1 %) a jejich meziroční růst postupně během roku zpomaloval. Celkový objem vyplacených mezd a platů nominálně vzrostl o 7,8 % při současném navýšení celkové zaměstnanosti o 0,8 %, ale vzhledem k pokračujícímu růstu cenové hladiny výdělky reálně klesly o 1,2 %.

Předchozí údaje jistě mají svoji váhu, ale zdaleka nejsou těmi jedinými, které Český statistický úřad veřejnosti nabízí k dotvoření co nejvíce uceleného obrazu o dění v naší zemi. Na stránkách Statistické ročenky tak, kromě řady dalších standardně publikovaných informací, naleznete i nově zařazené tabulky o digitální ekonomice, výzkumu a vývoji, vzdělávání či sociálním zabezpečení. Zcela nové údaje přineslo Integrované šetření v zemědělství a nově a do většího detailu byla též přepracována pasáž věnující se kriminalitě a soudnictví. V neposlední řadě nelze opominout též volby do Evropského parlamentu či výsledky Olympijských her v Paříži, přičemž tyto údaje již zasahují do roku 2024.

Jak již bylo řečeno v úvodu, moderní oficiální statistika se dnes nespoléhá pouze na ročenky. Využívá řadu progresivních nástrojů a snaží se sledovat moderní trendy jak v samotné statistické práci, tak i v prezentaci statistických údajů uživatelům. Český statistický úřad má od letošního roku nový web a modernizuje i svoji databázi. Nabízí také čím dál více údajů ve formátu otevřených dat. Naleznete nás na sociálních sítích, vydáváme popularizační i impaktované časopisy. A cizí nám již nejsou ani zprudka se rozvíjející možnosti umělé inteligence. I přesto je Statistická ročenka stále platným praktickým pomocníkem, který na jednom místě koncentruje podstatné a důvěryhodné informace pro všechny, kteří je potřebují pro svoji práci, studium a odpovědné rozhodování. Patří se proto na tomto místě poděkovat všem, kteří se na tvorbě tohoto úctyhodného díla podíleli a podílejí. Tedy zaměstnancům Českého statistického úřadu, partnerským organizacím a rovněž našim respondentům, bez jejichž zapojení by bylo sestavování jakýchkoliv statistik prakticky nemožné.

Dear readers,
You are now opening already the 32nd edition of the Statistical Yearbook in the modern history of the Czech Republic. The history of the Yearbook naturally goes much deeper and is related to all previously published yearbooks from the Czechoslovak era. It thus forms a coherent series of publications that bring in one place the most essential information from all important areas of the life of our country and its population. Although nowadays we use a number of modern tools in statistics, e.g. web applications, on-line databases, open data, or geoportals, the importance of the Statistical Yearbook remains – even despite the fact that the number of printed copies is gradually decreasing and users are increasingly using its electronic version.

The current Yearbook primarily describes phenomena that took place in 2023. So what was the year like? At the end of 2023, the population of Czechia was over 10.9 million for the first time since the end of the World War II and the positive net migration (94.7 thousand persons) was, after the one in 2022, the second highest in the post-war history of Czechia. In the migration balance, citizens of Ukraine dominated (75.2 thousand), followed by citizens of Slovakia (5.6 thousand), and, for the first time ever, Filipinos (2.1 thousand) ranked third. The year 2023 was further characterised by a considerable twelve percent decrease in the number of marriages. For the first time since 2005, fewer than 100 thousand children (91.1 thousand) were born alive. The life expectancy at birth was growing for the second year already, thus following a positive trend from before the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Czech economy faced in 2023 a combination of an influence of increasing external demand, domestic investment activity, and government consumption on the one hand and a continuing decline in household consumption and a negative impact of changes in inventories on the other. This mixture entailed fluctuating of the economy in a zone of stagnation; the gross domestic product (GDP) in total decreased by 0.1% last year. Consumer prices increased by 10.7% (in 2022, it was by 15.1%) and their year-on-year growth was gradually slowing down during the year. The total volume of wages and salaries paid increased in nominal terms by 7.8%, while the total employment increased by 0.8%; however, earnings decreased by 1.2% in real terms as the price level continued to grow.

The aforementioned data certainly have their weight, however, they are far from being the only ones that the Czech Statistical Office offers to the public to complete the most comprehensive picture of what is happening in the country. On the pages of the Statistical Yearbook, in addition to a range of other standard published information, you will thus also find newly inserted tables on the digital economy, research and development, education, and social security. Brand new data were brought by the Integrated Farm Survey. A section devoted to crime and justice has also been elaborated newly and with greater detail. Last but not least, the elections to the European Parliament and results of the Olympic Games in Paris should also be noted, while those data already extend to the year 2024.

As it was already mentioned in the introduction, modern official statistics today does not rely solely on yearbooks. It uses a number of progressive tools and tries to follow modern trends both in statistical work itself and in presenting statistical data to users. Since 2024, the Czech Statistical Office has a new website and it is also modernising its database. It offers more and more data in the open data format, too. We can be found on social media; we publish magazines and impact journals. And we’re no stranger to the burgeoning possibilities of artificial intelligence, either. Nevertheless, the Statistical Yearbook is still a valid practical tool that concentrates essential and trustworthy information in one place for all those who need it for their work, study, and responsible decision-making. It is therefore appropriate to thank here all those who have contributed and are contributing to production of this remarkable work. That is, the staff of the Czech Statistical Office, partner organisations, and also our respondents without the involvement of whom the compilation of any statistics would be virtually impossible.
Marek Rojíček
President of the Czech Statistical Office

Vybrané ukazatele národního hospodářství (Key national economy indicators) jsou důležitými měřítky pro hodnocení ekonomického výkonu a stability země. Tyto ukazatele zahrnují různé aspekty, jako je hrubý domácí produkt (HDP), inflace, nezaměstnanost a obchodní bilance.

HDP je klíčovým ukazatelem, který měří celkovou hodnotu zboží a služeb vyprodukovaných v zemi za určité období. Inflace ukazuje, jak se mění ceny zboží a služeb v čase, zatímco míra nezaměstnanosti ukazuje procento pracovní síly, které je bez práce. Obchodní bilance pak ukazuje rozdíl mezi exportem a importem zboží a služeb.

Tyto ukazatele jsou sledovány vládními institucemi, ekonomickými analytiky a investory, aby se lépe porozumělo ekonomickému zdraví a trendům v zemi.

Metodické vysvětlivky
Česká republika s rozlohou 78871 km² je vnitrozemským státem, ležícím uprostřed mírného pásu severní polokoule ve střední části Evropy. Státní hranice tvoří sousedství s Německem (818,9 km), Polskem (795,8 km), Rakouskem (460,4 km) a Slovenskem (251,8 km). Hodnoty odpovídají poslednímu přeměření a jsou platné k 9. únoru 2024. Počtem obyvatel 10900555 je podle údajů Eurostatu (k 1. lednu 2024) mezi 27 státy Evropské unie na 9. místě.

Od 1. ledna 2000 platí v České republice nové územní uspořádání a stávající okresy jsou seskupeny do 14 krajů, včetně hl. m. Prahy jako samostatného kraje. Na konci roku 2002 byla ukončena činnost okresních úřadů a významná část jejich kompetencí byla přenesena na 205 obcí s rozšířenou působností, které zahájily svoji činnost od 1. ledna 2003. Zákon č. 51/2020 Sb., o územně správním členění státu a o změně souvisejících zákonů, nově stanovuje, že území České republiky se člení na správní obvody krajů, které se skládají ze správních obvodů obcí s rozšířenou působností (s výjimkou hlavního města Prahy). Správní obvody obcí s rozšířenou působností jsou vymezeny výčtem obcí a vojenských újezdů. Těmito správními obvody jsou vymezeny též okresy (v hlavním městě Praze jsou na úrovni okresů obvody).

V návaznosti na tento zákon vydalo Ministerstvo vnitra vyhlášky, které správní obvody vymezují. V souvislosti s tím došlo s účinností od 1. 1. 2021 ke změně území okresů Nymburk, Kolín, Domažlice, Plzeň-jih, Semily, Jablonec nad Nisou, Vsetín a Zlín. Změnila se také území správních obvodů obcí s rozšířenou působností Český Brod, Lysá nad Labem, Turnov, Jablonec nad Nisou, Havlíčkův Brod a Jihlava. Naopak na úrovni krajů k žádné územní změně nedošlo.

Územím České republiky prochází hlavní evropské rozvodí oddělující povodí Severního, Baltského a Černého moře. Rozvodním uzlem těchto tří moří je Klepáč (1144 m n. m.) v masivu Králického Sněžníku. Hlavní říční osy jsou v Čechách Labe (370 km) s Vltavou (431 km) a Ohře (254 km), na jižní Moravě především Morava (269 km) s Dyjí (194 km) a na severu Moravy a ve Slezsku Odra (135 km) s Opavou (131 km).

Z hlediska fyzicko-geografického leží Česká republika na rozhraní dvou různých horských soustav, lišících se od sebe stářím i geologickým a geomorfologickým vývojem. Západní a střední část České republiky vyplňuje Česká vysočina, vytvořená v podstatě koncem prvohor a mající převážně ráz pahorkatin, a středohory (Šumava, Český les, Krušné hory, Krkonoše, Orlické hory, Jeseníky). Do východní části státu zasahují Západní Karpaty, které nabyly své nynější podoby v třetihorách (Beskydy). Rozhraní mezi oběma horskými systémy vyplňuje pásmo úvalů.

Podnebí České republiky se vyznačuje vzájemným pronikáním a míšením oceánských a kontinentálních vlivů. Je charakterizováno západním prouděním s převahou západních větrů, intenzivní cyklonální činností způsobující časté střídání vzduchových hmot a poměrně hojnými srážkami. Přímořský vliv se projevuje hlavně v Čechách, na Moravě a ve Slezsku přibývá kontinentálních podnebních vlivů. Velký vliv na podnebí České republiky má nadmořská výška a reliéf. Z celkové plochy státního území leží 52817 km² (66,97 %) v nadmořské výšce do 500 m, 25222 km² (31,98 %) ve výšce od 500 m do 1000 m a pouze 827 km² (1,05 %) ve výšce nad 1000 m. Střední nadmořská výška České republiky je 430 m.

Rovněž flóra a fauna vyskytující se na území České republiky svědčí o vzájemném pronikání hlavních směrů, kterými se v Evropě šířilo rostlinstvo a živočišstvo. Lesy, převážně jehličnaté, zaujímají přibližně 34 % celkové rozlohy České republiky. Také půdní pokryv se vyznačuje značnou variabilitou, a to jak zrnitostním složením půd, tak i rozšířením jednotlivých půdních typů. Nejrozšířenějším typem půd v České republice jsou hnědé půdy.

Methodological notes
The Czech Republic is a land-locked country with the area of 78871 square kilometres lying in the central part of Europe in the middle of the Northern Temperate Zone of the Northern Hemisphere. The country has borders with Germany (818.9 km), Poland (795.8 km), Austria (460.4 km), and Slovakia (251.8 km). The values come from the latest measurements and are valid as at 9 February 2024. With the population of 10900555, the Czech Republic ranks 9th among 27 countries of the European Union according to data of Eurostat (as at 1 January 2024).
Since 1 January 2000, the Czech Republic has a new territorial structure; current Districts make up 14 Regions, including the Capital City of Prague, which forms a separate Hl. m. Praha Region. Activities of the former district offices (authorities) were terminated at the end of 2002 and a significant part of their powers was delegated to 205 municipalities with extended powers, which began to function on 1 January 2003.
The Act No 51/2020 Sb, on the Administrative Territorial Structure of the State and amending certain related acts, newly determines that the territory of the Czech Republic is subdivided into administrative districts of Regions, which consist of administrative districts of municipalities with extended powers (except for the Capital City of Prague). Administrative districts of municipalities with extended powers are specified by listing of municipalities and military districts. Districts are also determined by those administrative districts (in the Capital City of Prague, a city district called “obvod” in Czech is on the level of a District (called “okres” in Czech).
Following this Act, the Ministry of the Interior issued decrees, which define administrative districts. In relation to it, the territory of the following Districts changed with effect from 1 January 2021: Nymburk, Kolín, Domažlice, Plzeň-jih, Semily, Jablonec nad Nisou, Vsetín, and Zlín. Territories of the following administrative districts of municipalities with extended powers also changed: Český Brod, Lysá nad Labem, Turnov, Jablonec nad Nisou, Havlíčkův Brod, and Jihlava. Contrarily, on the level of Regions, no changes to their territory occurred.
The main European watershed separating the basins of the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the Black Sea passes through the territory of the Czech Republic. The mountain of Klepáč (altitude 1144 m) located in the massif of Králický Sněžník is the divide node of the three seas. The major rivers are as follows: the Labe River (370 km), the Vltava River (431 km), and the Ohře River (254 km) in Bohemia, mainly the Morava River (269 km) and the Dyje River (194 km) in South Moravia, and the Odra River (135 km) and the Opava River (131 km) in the north of Moravia and in Silesia.
Geographically, the Czech Republic lies on the boundary of two different mountain systems, which differ in their age as well as their geological and geomorphological evolution. The western and the central part of the Czech Republic are covered with the uplands of Česká vysočina, formed basically at the end of the Palaeozoic era and being for the most part of a hilly nature, and with highlands (the mountain ranges of Šumava, Český les, Krušné hory, Krkonoše, Orlické hory, and Jeseníky).
The mountains of Západní Karpaty, which gained their current appearance in the Tertiary era (the mountain range of Beskydy), projects into the eastern part of the country. The boundary between the two mountain systems is filled with a belt of valleys.
The climate of the Czech Republic is influenced by mutual penetration and mingling of ocean and continental effects. Prevailing westerly winds, intensive cyclonic activity causing frequent alternating of air masses, and relatively ample precipitation are characteristic for the climate. Maritime effects are mainly felt in Bohemia, whereas Moravia and Silesia are more affected by the continental climate. The Czech Republic’s climate is strongly influenced by the country’s altitude and its geographical relief: 52817 km² (66.97%) of the country’s territory are located at an altitude of up to 500 m, 25222 km² (31.98%) lie at an altitude from 500 to 1000 m, and only 827 km² (1.05%) are at an altitude above 1000 m. The average altitude of the Czech Republic is 430 m.
Also wild fauna and flora species of the Czech Republic bear evidence of the mutual penetration of principal directions, in which wild fauna and flora species spread across Europe. Forests, mostly coniferous, cover approximately 34% of the total area of the Czech Republic.
The soil mantle also features considerable variability in terms of both – the soil texture composition and the distribution of respective soil types. Brown soils are the most frequent soil type in the Czech Republic.
