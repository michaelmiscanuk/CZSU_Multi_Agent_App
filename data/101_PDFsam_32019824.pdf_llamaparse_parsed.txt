Metodické vysvětlivky
Životním prostředím je vše, co vytváří přirozené podmínky existence organizmů, včetně člověka, a je předpokladem jejich dalšího vývoje. Jeho složkami jsou zejména ovzduší, voda, horniny, půda, organizmy, ekosystémy a energie.

Odpadovým hospodářstvím je činnost zaměřená na předcházení vzniku odpadů, na nakládání s odpady a na následnou péči o místo, kde jsou odpady trvale uloženy, a kontrola těchto činností.

Vodní hospodářství zahrnuje všechny činnosti směřující k využití, rozvoji a ochraně vodních zdrojů a k ochraně před škodlivými účinky vod.

Výdaje na ochranu životního prostředí zahrnují výdaje na pořízení dlouhodobého hmotného majetku na ochranu životního prostředí a neinvestiční náklady na ochranu životního prostředí. Data jsou získána z ročního statistického výkazu ČSÚ. Údaje o dlouhodobém hmotném majetku (DHM) představují sumu výdajů, které vykazující jednotky vynaložily na pořízení DHM (koupí nebo vlastní činností), spolu s celkovou hodnotou DHM získaného formou bezúplatného nabytí nebo převodu podle příslušných legislativních předpisů nebo přeřazením z osobního užívání do podnikání. Neinvestiční náklady zahrnují mzdové náklady, platby nájemného, energie a ostatní materiál a platby za služby, u kterých je hlavním účelem ochrana životního prostředí.

Poznámky k tabulkám
Tab. 3-1 Bilance půdy
Veškerá zemědělská i nezemědělská půda se zjišťuje sumarizací přehledů o plochách kultur podle údajů katastru nemovitostí, vedeného orgány Českého úřadu zeměměřického a katastrálního k 31. prosinci vykazovaného roku. Zemědělská půda zahrnuje ornou půdu, chmelnice, vinice, zahrady, ovocné sady a trvalé travní porosty. Do nezemědělské půdy jsou zařazeny lesní pozemky, vodní plochy, zastavěné plochy a ostatní plochy. Veškeré údaje o půdě jsou zjišťovány jako plochy kultur zemědělských i nezemědělských závodů nebo soukromých vlastníků bez rozlišení typu hospodaření a velikosti pozemků.

Tab. 3-2 až 3-6 Zvláště chráněná území a soustava Natura 2000
Podle zákona č. 114/1992 Sb., o ochraně přírody a krajiny, ve znění pozdějších předpisů, je rozlišováno šest kategorií zvláště chráněných území. Národní parky a chráněné krajinné oblasti – označované jako velkoplošná zvláště chráněná území, a národní přírodní rezervace, přírodní rezervace, národní přírodní památky a přírodní památky – označované jako maloplošná zvláště chráněná území. Údaje o ubytovacích zařízeních v národních parcích jsou získávány ze šetření o kapacitách a návštěvnosti hromadných ubytovacích zařízení. Uváděné údaje jsou souhrnem dat za zpracované dotazníky a dopočtenou non-response. Natura 2000 je soustava chráněných území, která vytvářejí na svém území podle jednotných principů všechny státy Evropské unie. Vytvoření soustavy Natura 2000 ukládají dva nejdůležitější právní předpisy EU na ochranu přírody – směrnice EP a Rady 2009/147/ES, o ochraně volně žijících ptáků a směrnice Rady 92/43/EHS, o ochraně přírodních stanovišť, volně žijících živočichů a planě rostoucích rostlin. Požadavky obou směrnic jsou implementovány do národní legislativy prostřednictvím zákona č. 114/1992 Sb. Na území České republiky je Natura 2000 tvořena vymezenými ptačími oblastmi a vyhlášenými evropsky významnými lokalitami. Od 1. 3. 2017 došlo ke změně metodiky výpočtu souhrnných rozloh chráněných území. Rozlohy jsou od tohoto data vypočítávány ve všech případech z obvodových hranic chráněných území. Nevyužívají se již číselné údaje z vyhlašovací dokumentace. Údaje uváděné v tabulkách byly převzaty od Agentury ochrany přírody a krajiny České republiky.

Tab. 3-7 až 3-12 Emise ze zdrojů znečišťování ovzduší a měrné emise hlavních znečišťujících látek
Mezi hlavní sledované znečišťující látky vznikající především při spalování tuhých a kapalných paliv a vypouštěné do ovzduší patří tuhé látky (polétavý prach, popílek), oxid siřičitý (SO₂), oxidy dusíku (NOₓ), oxid uhelnatý (CO) a uhlovodíky (CxHy). Od roku 2002 bylo vykazování emisí uhlovodíků nahrazeno vykazováním nemetanových těkavých organických látek (NMVOC), které zahrnují také emise z používání rozpouštědel a nátěrových hmot, např. pro venkovní údržbu a v domácnostech. Množství uvedených znečišťujících látek vypouštěné do ovzduší je vykazováno v Registru emisí a stacionárních zdrojů (REZZO). Od roku 2013 jsou v souvislosti se změnou kategorizace zdrojů podle přílohy 2 zákona o ochraně ovzduší nově vymezeny zdroje REZZO na: – REZZO 1, REZZO 2 – zahrnují stacionární zařízení ke spalování paliv o celkovém tepelném příkonu vyšším než 0,3 MW, spalovny odpadů, jiné zdroje (technologické spalovací procesy, průmyslové výroby, aj.). REZZO 1 – ohlašované emise, REZZO 2 – emise vypočítávané z ohlášených spotřeb paliv a emisních faktorů; – REZZO 3 – zahrnuje stacionární zařízení ke spalování paliv o celkovém tepelném příkonu do 0,3 MW, nevyjmenované technologické procesy (použití rozpouštědel v domácnostech apod., stavební práce, zemědělské činnosti); – REZZO 4 – zahrnuje silniční, železniční, lodní a leteckou dopravu osob a přepravu nákladu, u silniční dopravy dále otěry brzd a pneumatik, abraze vozovky a odpary z palivových systémů benzinových vozidel, provoz nesilničních strojů a mechanizmů při údržbě zeleně a lesů, apod.

– REZZO 3, REZZO 4 – vypočtené emise z aktivitních údajů, získaných např. ze sčítání lidu, domů a bytů (SLDB), výrobních a energetických statistik, sčítání dopravy a registru vozidel apod., a emisních faktorů. Podrobnější informace naleznete na: www.chmi.cz/files/portal/docs/uoco/oez/emisnibilance_CZ.html.

Měrné emise jsou emise znečišťujících látek za určité časové období, připadající na jednotku plochy území.

Tab. 3-13 a 3-14 Imise ve vybraných lokalitách a na pozaďových stanicích. Pozaďová stanice je stanice umístěná v oblastech s nižší hustotou obyvatelstva, značně vzdálených od městských a průmyslových oblastí a stranou od emisí z lokálních zdrojů; mimo místa, v nichž se tvoří přízemní inverze a mimo vyšší horské vrcholy. Imisní limit je nejvýše přípustná hmotnostní koncentrace znečišťující látky obsažená v ovzduší. Přípustné průměrné roční koncentrace jsou stanoveny pro oxid siřičitý – 50 μg/m³ a pro PM₁₀ – 40 μg/m³.

Metody měření:
– oxid siřičitý (SO₂) – zjišťován kolorimetricky, coulometricky a metodou UV-fluorescence;
– PM₁₀ – respirabilní frakce prašného aerosolu s aerodynamickým průměrem 50 % částic menším než 10 μm, zjišťováno radiometricky;
– oxidy dusíku (NOₓ) – zjišťovány kolorimetricky a metodou chemiluminiscence;
– kyselost srážek (pH) – zjišťována pH-metricky. Kyselost srážek se uvádí podle stupnice od hodnoty 14 do hodnoty 1, kde stupeň 14 je extrémně zásadité prostředí, stupeň 7 je neutrální prostředí a stupeň 1 je extrémně kyselé prostředí.

Tab. 3-15 Emise oxidu uhličitého a dalších skleníkových plynů. Změna klimatu je v současnosti považována za jeden z nejzávažnějších globálních problémů. Klimatický systém je ovlivňován celou řadou lidských aktivit, přičemž převažující úloha se přičítá emisím skleníkových plynů, které způsobují zesilování skleníkového efektu. Za hlavní antropogenní skleníkové plyny se považují oxid uhličitý (CO₂), metan (CH₄), oxid dusný (N₂O), částečně (HFC) a úplně (PFC) fluorované deriváty uhlovodíků, fluorid sírový (SF₆) a fluorid dusitý (NF₃) – souhrnně jsou označovány jako fluorované skleníkové plyny, zkráceně F-plyny.

Emise CO₂ pocházejí zejména ze spalování fosilních paliv, rozkladu uhličitanů při výrobě cementu, vápna, skla, při odsiřování a v metalurgických a chemických výrobách; k emisím a propadům CO₂ (při celkové bilanci sektoru od roku 2018 převažují emise) dochází v sektoru Využívání krajiny, změny ve využití krajiny a lesnictví (LULUCF). Antropogenní emise metanu v České republice pocházejí zejména z těžby, úpravy a distribuce paliv; tento typ zdrojů je označován jako fugitivní. Dalšími významnými zdroji emisí metanu je chov zvířat, anaerobní rozklad bioodpadů při jejich ukládání na skládky a čištění odpadních vod. Největší množství emisí oxidu dusného v České republice pochází ze zemědělských aktivit, zejména denitrifikací dusíku dodávaného do půdy ve formě umělých hnojiv nebo organického materiálu. Mezi další významné zdroje patří výroba kyseliny dusičné. Jelikož F-plyny nejsou v České republice vyráběny, jejich emise pocházejí z použití těchto látek zejména v chladírenství, v menší míře se používají jako nadouvadla pro výrobu pěnových izolačních hmot, hnací plyny pro některé aerosolové přípravky, náplně hasicích přístrojů a izolační medium v silnoproudé elektrotechnice.

Emise skleníkových plynů jsou sledovány Rámcovou úmluvou OSN o změně klimatu včetně jejího Kjótského protokolu a na základě Nařízení Evropského parlamentu a Rady (EU) č. 525/2013 o mechanismu monitorování a vykazování emisí skleníkových plynů a podávání dalších informací na úrovni členských států a Unie vztahujících se ke změně klimatu a o zrušení rozhodnutí č. 280/2004. Toto Nařízení bylo od roku 2020 nahrazeno Nařízením č. 2018/1999 o správě energetické unie a opatření v oblasti klimatu, kterým se mění nařízení Evropského parlamentu a Rady (ES) č. 663/2009 a (ES) č. 715/2009, směrnice Evropského parlamentu a Rady 94/22/ES, 98/70/ES, 2009/31/ES, 2009/73/ES, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU a 2013/30/EU, směrnice Rady 2009/119/ES a (EU) 2015/652 a zrušuje nařízení Evropského parlamentu a Rady (EU) č. 525/2013. Evropská Komise nicméně plánuje připravit odpovídající platformy pro vykazování až od roku 2023, a tak i nadále vyžaduje od svých členských států vykazovat emisní inventarizace na základě Nařízení č. 525/2013. Je důležité zmínit, že na hodnoty emisí a systém vykazování ale nebude mít nové nařízení žádný zásadní vliv, tudíž se není třeba obávat jakýchkoli změn. Hodnoty emisí jsou stanovovány podle předepsané metodiky IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – Mezivládní panel pro změnu klimatu). Z důvodů vývoje metodiky a důsledného zavádění kontrolních mechanismů QA/QC dochází občas v zájmu zvýšení přesnosti emisních stanovení ke zpětným přepočtům, a proto může v jednotlivých letech docházet k drobným změnám oproti dříve vykázaným údajům.

Emise z mezinárodní dopravy nejsou v současné době zahrnuty do závazků Rámcové úmluvy OSN o změně klimatu ani do Kjótského protokolu. Proto se nezapočítávají do celkových národních emisí a vykazují se jako zvláštní položka. Emise jsou v tabulce vyjádřeny v ekvivalentním množství CO₂.

Tab. 3-16 Stav přízemní vrstvy ozonu. Maximální hodnota přízemní vrstvy ozonu je údaj pro maximální denní hodnotu osmihodinového průměru v čase 9.00 až 17.00 hod. Údaje o stavu přízemní vrstvy ozonu jsou zjišťovány metodou UV-absorbance. Údaje uváděné v tabulkách 3-7 až 3-16 byly převzaty od Českého hydrometeorologického ústavu.

Tab. 3-17 Celkové množství ozonu v atmosféře
Měření ozonu se provádí Dobsonovým spektrofotometrem. Princip měření spočívá v určení rozsahu selektivní absorpce (úměrné množství ozonu) slunečního záření ozonem po jeho průchodu zemskou atmosférou na určitých vlnových délkách. Všechny hodnoty jsou uvedeny v Dobsonových jednotkách (DU) stupnice BP. Údaje uvedené v tabulce byly převzaty ze Solární a ozonové observatoře v Hradci Králové – pracoviště Českého hydrometeorologického ústavu.

Tab. 3-18 až 3-23 Produkce odpadů
Odpad je jakákoliv látka nebo předmět, kterých se držitel zbavuje nebo má v úmyslu se zbavit nebo se od něho požaduje, aby se jich zbavil. Nebezpečný odpad je odpad vykazující jednu, nebo více nebezpečných vlastností uvedených v nařízení Komise (EU) č. 1357/2014 ze dne 18. prosince 2014, kterým se nahrazuje příloha III směrnice Evropského parlamentu a Rady 2008/98/ES o odpadech a o zrušení některých směrnic. Produkce odpadů představuje objem vlastní produkce odpadů, včetně produkce sekundárního odpadu (odpad ze zpracování odpadu). Nezahrnuje objem odpadu převzatého ze skladu, dovoz odpadů ani odpad převzatý od jiného subjektu (s výjimkou odpadu od občanů a odpadu od subjektů, které ISPOP nevyplňují). Nakládáním s odpady se rozumí využití a odstraňování odpadů. Do nakládání se nezahrnují přípravné operace, vývoz odpadu, uskladnění ani předání jiné osobě. Naopak nakládání kromě vlastní produkce může zahrnovat i dovoz odpadů nebo zůstatek na skladě z předchozích období. Z těchto důvodů se objem produkce odpadu nerovná objemu odpadu, s kterým je nakládáno. Podle nařízení Evropského parlamentu a Rady (ES) č. 2150/2002 o statistice odpadů, ve znění pozdějších předpisů se za nakládání s odpady považuje:
– využívání odpadů – operace stanovené v příloze č. II výše uvedeného nařízení;
– odstraňování odpadů – operace stanovené v příloze č. II výše uvedeného nařízení.

Komunální odpad je:
– směsný odpad a odděleně sbíraný odpad z domácností, včetně papíru a lepenky, skla, kovů, plastů, biologického odpadu, dřeva, textilu, obalů, elektrického odpadu a elektronických zařízení, použité baterie a akumulátory a objemný odpad, včetně matrací a nábytku;
– směsný odpad a odděleně sbíraný odpad z ostatních zdrojů, pokud je povahou a složením podobný odpadu z domácnosti. Komunální odpad nezahrnuje odpad z výroby, zemědělství, lesnictví, rybolovu, septiků a čistíren odpadních vod a čištění, včetně čistírenských kalů, vozidel s ukončenou životností nebo stavební a demoliční odpad. Definicí dále není dotčeno rozdělení odpovědnosti za nakládání s odpady mezi veřejnými a soukromými subjekty. Odpad z domácností a odpady podobné povahy a složení budou zahrnuty do komunálního odpadu, bez ohledu na to, kdo tento odpad sbírá. Komunální odpad zahrnuje odpad pocházející z:
– domácností;
– obchodů, malých podniků, kancelářských budov a institucí (např. školy, nemocnice, vládní budovy);
– podniků, pokud je druhem a složením podobný odpadu z domácnosti a nepochází z výroby;
– vybraných komunálních služeb, tj. odpad z údržby parků a zahrad, odpad ze služeb čištění ulic (např. zametání ulic, odpad z čištění tržišť), pokud je s ním nakládáno jako s odpadem.

EWC-STAT je klasifikace odpadů dle Nařízení 2150/2002. Na rozdíl od klasifikace používané v Katalogu odpadů nerozlišuje, kde odpad vznikl, kdo jej vyprodukoval, ale rozlišení je pouze podle druhu látky tvořící odpad. Regionální (krajské) členění je prováděno podle sídla provozovny (místní jednotky), nikoli podle sídla podniku. Data uvedená v tabulkách 3-18 až 3-23 vycházejí z údajů systému ISPOP (informační systém plnění ohlašovacích povinností).

Tab. 3-24 Znečištění vypouštěné do vodních toků a havárie na vodních zdrojích
Znečištění vypouštěné do vodních toků se uvádí v tunách za rok, a to odděleně pro jednotlivé znečišťující látky, které jsou specifikovány jako:
– nerozpuštěné látky (NL) – látky, které se stanoví filtrací vody a vysoušením zbytku filtru při 105 ºC do konstantní hmotnosti;
– rozpuštěné anorganické soli (RAS) – látky, které zůstávají ve filtrátu vzorku vody po odpaření, vysušení a vyžíhání při 600 ºC do konstantní hmotnosti;
– biochemická spotřeba kyslíku (BSK₅) – množství kyslíku spotřebovaného k aerobnímu biochemickému rozkladu organických látek obsažených ve vodě po dobu pěti dnů při standardních podmínkách;
– chemická spotřeba kyslíku (CHSKCr) – spotřeba kyslíku stanovená dichromanovou metodou. Údaje za havárie na vodních zdrojích byly převzaty od České inspekce životního prostředí.

Tab. 3-25 Vodní toky a odběry povrchové vody ve správě podniků Povodí, s. p.
Rozhodující část vodních toků je svěřena do správy vodohospodářských organizací – státním podnikům Povodí. Do délky vodních toků (v km) se zahrnují toky upravené, částečně upravené a neupravené. Nezahrnují se délky odvodňovacích a zavlažovacích kanálů a přivaděčů. Délka vodních toků je od roku 2011 ovlivněna transformací Zemědělské vodohospodářské správy, v rámci které přešla správa drobných vodních toků převážně na podniky Povodí, s. p. Od roku 2013 je délka vodních toků vykazována podle Centrální evidence vodních toků, přičemž průběžně probíhá revize jejich zatřídění.

Tab. 3-26 až 3-31 Vodovody, kanalizace a čistírny odpadních vod pro veřejnou potřebu, produkce kalů v ČOV
Obor vodovodů a kanalizací zahrnuje vodohospodářské činnosti související se správou a provozem vodovodů a kanalizací, tj. zajišťování dostatečného množství kvalitní pitné vody a zajišťování odvádění odpadních vod a jejich čištění. Vodovody a kanalizace pro veřejnou potřebu zahrnují vodovody a kanalizace zřízené a provozované ve veřejném zájmu. V roce 2021 jsou data za počty a podíly obyvatel zásobovaných vodou z vodovodů pro veřejnou potřebu a obyvatel trvale bydlících v domech napojených na kanalizaci pro veřejnou potřebu ovlivněna výsledky Sčítání lidu, domů a bytů 2021 a nejsou plně srovnatelná s předchozími roky. Voda vyrobená zahrnuje vodu fakturovanou a vodu nefakturovanou. Součet údajů vody fakturované a nefakturované se může lišit od údajů za vodu vyrobenou o vodu převzatou od jiných organizací, popř. o vodu předanou jiným organizacím. Za čistírnu odpadních vod (ČOV) se považují objekty a zařízení sloužící k čištění odpadních vod s mechanickým, biologickým, příp. dalším stupněm čištění. Za ČOV se nepovažují zařízení pro hrubé předčištění odpadních vod (česle, lapače písku, lapače oleje apod.), septiky, žumpy a jednoduchá zařízení s mechanickou funkcí, která nejsou pravidelně sledována a obsluhována. Kapacita ČOV je uvedena jako projektovaná kapacita čistíren v m³/den. Vyšší kapacita než je projektovaná, se uvádí tehdy, když provedená intenzifikační opatření byla schválena vodoprávním úřadem. Údaje v tabulkách 3-24 až 3-31 byly získány na základě zpracování výkazů ČSÚ od organizací spravujících vodní toky a provozovatelů vodovodů a kanalizací. Údaje za vodovody a kanalizace jsou výsledkem pravidelného šetření hlavních provozovatelů a výběrového souboru obcí. Následně jsou pak dopočteny na úroveň krajů a Českou republiku celkem.

Tab. 3-32 až 3-37 Investice, neinvestiční náklady a ekonomický přínos z aktivit na ochranu životního prostředí
Ochrana životního prostředí se člení na devět oblastí: Ochrana ovzduší a klimatu zahrnuje úpravu technologických procesů z důvodu prevence vzniku znečištění (na ochranu ovzduší, klimatu a ozonové vrstvy), odstraňování odpadních plynů a odvětrávaného vzduchu, odstraňování tuhých a plynných emisí, monitorovací zařízení pro sledování čistoty ovzduší apod. Nakládání s odpadními vodami zahrnuje úpravu technologických procesů z důvodu prevence vzniku znečištění, výstavbu čistíren odpadních vod, výstavbu kanalizačních sítí se zajištěným napojením na čistírnu odpadních vod, nakládání s chladícími vodami, monitorovací zařízení ke sledování jakosti vody apod. Nakládání s odpady zahrnuje úpravu technologických procesů z důvodu prevence vzniku odpadů, zařízení a vybavení pro sběr, svoz, přepravu, třídění a úpravu odpadů, výstavbu spaloven, recyklačních závodů, řízených skládek, kompostáren, asanaci starých skládek, zařízení pro monitoring odpadů apod.

Údaje uvedené v tabulkách jsou čerpány z ročních výkazů ČSÚ.

Tab. 3-38 Výdaje vybraných ústředních vládních institucí na životní prostředí
Výdaje na životní prostředí ze státních fondů se skládají z výdajů Státního fondu životního prostředí (bez administrativních výdajů na kancelář fondu) a Státního zemědělského intervenčního fondu, ze kterého se spolufinancují akce na ochranu životního prostředí.

Tab. 3-39 Příjmy a výdaje Státního fondu životního prostředí České republiky
Příjmy Státního fondu životního prostředí zahrnují příjmy z úplat a poplatků a prostředky Programu ochrany ovzduší. Ve výdajích jsou zahrnuty dotace a půjčky. Od roku 2009 získává fond příjmy z programu Zelená úsporám (GIS) – příjmy z prodeje emisních povolenek. Jedná se o účelově vyčleněné finanční prostředky na realizaci opatření vedoucích k úsporám energie a využití obnovitelných zdrojů energie v rodinných a bytových domech. Údaje v tabulkách 3-38 a 3-39 byly převzaty ze Státního fondu životního prostředí a Ministerstva financí.

Tab. 3-40 Vybrané indikátory materiálových toků
Většina environmentálních problémů přímo nebo nepřímo souvisí s průchodem materiálů ekonomikou. Cílem sestavování účtů materiálových toků na makroekonomické úrovni je kvantifikace celkových nároků ekonomického systému na materiály. Tyto nároky mohou být vyjádřeny jako vstupy materiálů do ekonomického systému, jejich spotřeba nebo celkové odpadní toky plynoucí z ekonomického systému zpět do životního prostředí. Přímý materiálový vstup (direct material input – DMI) – měří vstup používaných materiálů v hospodářství, tj. všechny materiály, které mají ekonomickou hodnotu a jsou používány pro výrobu a spotřebu. DMI je domácí užitá těžba (vytěžené suroviny, vypěstovaná biomasa) plus dovoz. Domácí materiálová spotřeba (domestic material consumption – DMC) – měří celkové množství materiálů přímo používaných v hospodářství. DMC je kalkulována jako DMI minus vývoz. K vstupním nebo výstupním indikátorům materiálových toků mohou být dále vztaženy indikátory ekonomické výkonnosti. Například HDP na jednotku DMI či DMC ukazují přímou materiálovou produktivitu ekonomiky. Naopak vztáhneme-li indikátory vstupu na HDP, získáme materiálovou náročnost hospodářství. Uvedené indikátory materiálových toků České republiky byly rozděleny do následujících kategorií: – biomasa (suroviny, polotovary a výrobky z biomasy); – fosilní paliva (suroviny, polotovary a výrobky z fosilních paliv); – kovové nerosty (suroviny, polotovary a výrobky z kovových nerostů); – nekovové nerosty (suroviny, polotovary a výrobky z průmyslových a stavebních nerostných surovin); – ostatní (ostatní výrobky jinde nezařazené a odpady).

Methodological notes
The environment shall mean everything that creates natural conditions for the existence of organisms, including human beings, and forms a prerequisite for their further evolution. It comprises especially the air, water, rocks, soil, organisms, ecosystems, and energy.

Waste management refers to activities focused on preventing waste generation, treatment (recovery and disposal) of waste, and the after-care of permanent disposal sites, as well as the supervision of such operations.

Water management refers to all activities aimed at the use, development, and protection of water sources and protection against harmful effects of waters.

Environmental protection expenditure includes costs of the acquisition of tangible fixed assets for environmental protection and non-investment costs for environmental protection. The data are collected by means of an annual statistical questionnaire of the CZSO. The data on tangible fixed assets are the sum of expenditure/costs, which reporting units spent on the tangible fixed assets acquisition (by a purchase or own activities) along with the total value of tangible fixed assets acquired for free or by a transfer according to relevant legislation or by the reclassification from the private use to business one. The non-investment costs include wages and salaries, payments for rents, energy and other material, and payments for services the principal purpose of which is environmental protection.

Notes on Tables
Table 3-1 Land use balance
All agricultural and non-agricultural land is measured by summing up crop areas recorded in the real estate cadastre kept by bodies of the Czech Office for Surveying, Mapping and Cadastre as at 31 December of the reference year. Agricultural land includes arable land, hop gardens, vineyards, gardens, orchards, and permanent grassland. Non-agricultural land includes forest land, surface water bodies, as well as built-up areas and other areas. All the data on land are measured as crop areas of agricultural holdings and non-agricultural enterprises, or of private owners, not differentiated by type of the land management and land size.

Tables 3-2 to 3-6 Specially protected areas and Natura 2000 network
The Act No 114/1992 Sb, on Nature Conservation and Landscape Protection, as subsequently amended, distinguishes six categories of specially protected areas. National parks and protected landscape areas, which are referred to as large-size specially protected areas, and national nature reserves, nature reserves, national nature monuments, and nature monuments, which are referred to as small-size specially protected areas. Data on accommodation establishments in national parks are obtained from a survey on capacities and number of guests in collective accommodation establishments. Data provided here are a summary of data from processed questionnaires (reports) and grossed up non-response.

Natura 2000 is a network of protected areas (sites) designated by all EU Member States in their territories under unified principles. Establishment of Natura 2000 network is assigned by two most important legal regulations of the EU for nature protection – Directive 2009/147/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the conservation of wild birds and Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora. Requirements of both the directives have been implemented in the national legislation by means of the Act No 114/1992 Sb. In the territory of the Czech Republic, Natura 2000 comprises of delimited Birds Directive sites (special protection areas, SPAs; in Czech “ptačí oblast”) and of declared Habitats Directive sites (sites of Community importance, SCIs; in Czech “evropsky významná lokalita”).

On 1 March 2017, methodology of the calculation of total land areas of protected areas changed. Since then, land areas of all protected areas have been calculated using borders of the respective protected areas. The figures written in respective decrees to the Act on Nature Conservation and Landscape Protection, which the protected areas were established by, are not applied anymore. The data given in the tables were taken from the Nature Conservation Agency of the Czech Republic.

Tables 3-7 to 3-12 Emissions from air pollution sources and specific emissions of main air pollutants
Main air pollutants monitored, which are generated, first of all, in the combustion of solid and liquid fuels and are released into the air, are particulate matter (e.g. PM₁₀, fly ash), sulphur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrocarbons (CxHy). From 2002 onwards, the reporting of hydrocarbon (CxHy) emissions has been replaced by the reporting of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), which also cover emissions from the use of solvents, paints, and varnishes, e.g. for outdoor maintenance and in households.

Amounts of mentioned pollutants released into the air are listed in the Register of Emissions and Stationary Sources (Registr emisí a stacionárních zdrojů – REZZO). From 2013 onwards, in connection with changes to the categorization of sources pursuant to the Annex 2 to the Air Protection Act, REZZO sources have been newly categorized as follows:

– REZZO 1, REZZO 2 categories include stationary installations for fuel combustion with the total heat output over 0.3 MW,
incineration plants, other sources (technological combustion processes, industrial productions, etc.). REZZO 1 – reported
emissions, REZZO 2 – emissions calculated from reported fuel consumption and emission factors;
– REZZO 3 category includes stationary installations for fuel combustion with the total heat output up to 0.3 MW, technological
processes that are not listed (use of dissolving agents in households, etc., construction works, agricultural activities);
– REZZO 4 category includes road, railway, water, and air passenger transport and freight transport; as for road transport it
further includes abrasion of breaks and tires, abrasion of the road surface, evaporation from fuelling systems of petrol-fuelled
vehicles, operation of non-road mobile machinery and mechanisms for landscape and forest maintenance, etc.;
– REZZO 3, REZZO 4 categories – emissions calculated from data on activities obtained, for example, from the Population
and Housing Census, production and energy statistics, traffic census and the Registry of motor vehicles, etc., and emission

In the emissions table for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, the climate change is considered to be one of the most serious global problems. The climate system is influenced by a number of anthropogenic activities, with the prevailing role assigned to emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which reinforce the greenhouse effect. The main anthropogenic greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF₆), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF₃), collectively known as fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases).
In the emissions table for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, CO₂ emissions originate mainly from fossil fuels combustion, carbonate decomposition in the production of cement, lime, and glass, in desulphurisation processes, and also in metallurgical and chemical production processes.
In the emissions table for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, the CO₂ emissions and sequestration occur in the sector of land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF); in the overall balance of the LULUCF sector, emissions have been prevailing since 2018.
In the emissions table for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, anthropogenic methane emissions in the Czech Republic originate mainly from mining, processing, and distribution of fuels, referred to as fugitive sources. Other significant methane emission sources include animal and livestock rearing and breeding, anaerobic decomposition of biological waste in landfills, and wastewater treatment.
In the emissions table for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, the largest amount of nitrous oxide emissions in the Czech Republic comes from agricultural activities, especially due to denitrification of nitrogen supplied to the soil in the form of artificial fertilisers or organic materials. The production of nitric acid is another important source of emissions.
In the emissions table for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, since fluorinated greenhouse gases are not produced in the Czech Republic, all emissions come from their use, mostly in the cooling industry, and to a lesser extent from their use as blowing agents in manufacturing foam insulation materials, propellants for some aerosol products, fillings for extinguishers, and insulating mediums in heavy current electric equipment.
In the emissions table for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, greenhouse gas emissions are monitored within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, including the Kyoto Protocol, and based on Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on a mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and for reporting other information at national and Union level relevant to climate change.
In the emissions table for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, this regulation has been replaced since 2020 by Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, along with various directives and council directives.

of the European Parliament and of the Council. However, the European Commission is planning to prepare corresponding platforms for reporting as of 2023 and therefore it still requires the Member States to report emission inventory pursuant to the Regulation No 525/2013. Nevertheless, it has to be mentioned that the new regulation will have no major impact on amounts of emissions and on the system of reporting and therefore one does not have to be afraid of any changes. Amounts of emissions are determined according to the required methodology of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) called the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and amendments. Due to constant development of the methodology and strict implementation of quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures, retroactive recalculations are performed from time to time and therefore minor changes may occur in respective years compared to the previously reported data. Currently, emissions from international transport are included neither in the commitments of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change nor in the Kyoto Protocol. Therefore, they are not involved in the total national emissions and are reported as a separate item. Emissions in the table are expressed as a CO₂ equivalent.

In the ground-level ozone concentrations table (Tabulka 3-16), the maximum ground-level ozone concentration refers to the maximum 8-hour average ozone concentration measured between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. The ground-level ozone concentrations are measured by the UV absorbance method. Data given in the Tables 3-7 through 3-16 were provided by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
In the total ozone amounts in the atmosphere table (Tabulka 3-17), the ozone concentration is measured by a Dobson spectrophotometer. The principle consists in the determination of wavelength-selective absorption (proportional to the ozone amount) of solar radiation passing through the atmosphere. All the measurements are given in Dobson units (DU) on the BP scale. The data in the table were provided by the Solar and Ozone Observatory in the city of Hradec Králové (Hradec Králové), a workplace of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
In the waste generation and management tables (Tabulky 3-18 až 3-23), waste means any substance or object which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard. A hazardous waste is defined as a waste that displays one or more of the hazardous properties listed in the Commission Regulation (EU) No 1357/2014 of 18 December 2014 replacing Annex III to Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on waste and repealing certain Directives. Waste generation is the volume of own waste generation, including secondary waste generation (waste from waste processing). It does not include the volume of waste taken from a warehouse (storage), imports of wastes or waste taken over from another entity (with the exception of waste from citizens and waste from entities, which do not fill in the Integrated Environmental Reporting System (administrative system of waste records in Czech abbreviated as ISPOP)). Waste management means waste recovery and disposal. Waste management does not include preparatory operations, the export of waste, storage, or transfer (handover) to another person. Conversely, in addition to own production, waste management (waste treated) may also involve the import of waste or the balance in storage from the previous periods. For these reasons, the volume of waste generated is not equal to the volume of waste that is treated. Waste treatment, according to the Regulation (EC) No 2150/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council on waste statistics, as subsequently amended, are subdivided into groups as follows: waste recovery – operations given in the Annex II to the aforementioned Regulation; waste disposal – operations given in the Annex II to the aforementioned Regulation. Municipal waste means mixed waste and separately collected waste from households, including paper and cardboard, glass, metals, plastics, bio-waste, wood, textiles, packaging, waste electrical and electronic equipment, waste batteries and accumulators, and bulky waste, including mattresses and furniture; mixed waste and separately collected waste from other sources, where such waste is similar in nature and composition to waste from households. Municipal waste does not include waste from production, agriculture, forestry, fishing, septic tanks and sewage network and treatment, including sewage sludge, end-of-life vehicles or construction and demolition waste.

This definition is without prejudice to the allocation of responsibilities for waste management between public and private actors. Waste from households and waste similar in nature and composition to waste from households will be included in municipal waste regardless of the waste collector. Municipal waste includes waste from:
– households;
– retail trade, small businesses, office buildings and institutions (such as schools, hospitals, government buildings);
– businesses provided that it is similar in nature and composition to household waste and it is not originating from production;
– selected municipal services, i.e. waste from park and garden maintenance, waste from street cleaning services (e.g. street sweeping, waste from cleaning of markets), provided that it is managed as waste.

EWC-STAT (European Waste Classification for Statistics) is a classification (waste statistical nomenclature) in the Regulation (EC) No 2150/2002. Unlike the classification used in the List of Waste (LoW), EWC-STAT is not origin-oriented (it does not distinguish who generated the waste); it is purely a substance oriented waste statistical nomenclature. The regional breakdown is made according to the registered office of the establishments (local units), not according to the registered office of the enterprise.

Data presented in the Tables 3-18 through 3-23 are based on data from the Integrated Environmental Reporting System (administrative system of waste records – ISPOP).

Table 3-24 Pollutants discharged into watercourses and accidents on water sources
Quantities of pollutants discharged into watercourses are given in tonnes per year, separately for respective pollutants defined as follows:
– insoluble matter (IM) – substances determined by the water filtration and drying of the filter residue to constant weight at 105 °C;
– dissolved inorganic salts – substances, which remain in the filtrate of a water sample after its evaporation, drying, and calcination (at 600 °C) to constant weight;
– biochemical oxygen demand (BOD₅) – the amount of oxygen consumed by the aerobic biochemical decomposition of organic matter contained in water for five days under standard conditions;
– chemical oxygen demand (CODCr) – the oxygen consumption determined by the dichromate method.

The data on water source accidents were provided by the Czech Environmental Inspectorate.

Table 3-25 Watercourses and surface water abstraction under administration of state-owned enterprises of Povodí
The decisive part of watercourses is under the administration of water management organisations, which are state-owned enterprises called Povodí s. p. (Catchment, s.o.e.). The length of watercourses (in km) includes canalised, partially canalised, and non-canalised natural watercourses; the length of drainage, irrigation, and feeding channels is not included. From 2011 onwards, the length of watercourses has been affected by the transformation of the Zemědělská vodohospodářská správa (Agricultural Water Management Administration), in which mostly companies of Povodí s. p. were delegated to do the water management of small watercourses. From 2013 onwards, the length of watercourses has been reported according to the Central Registry of Watercourses; their classification is revised on an ongoing basis.

Tables 3-26 to 3-31 Water supply systems, sewerage systems, and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for public needs; sludge generation in WWTPs
The domain of water supply systems and sewerage systems involves water management activities related to the management and operation of water supply and sewerage systems, i.e. production and distribution of drinking water in a sufficient amount and of good quality and wastewater collection and treatment. Public water supply systems and sewerage systems are water supply and sewerage systems established and operated in the public interest. In 2021, data on the numbers and percentages of population supplied with water from public water supply systems and population permanently living in houses connected to public sewerage systems are influenced by results of the 2021 Population and Housing Census and are not fully comparable to those of previous years.

Water produced includes both invoiced and non-invoiced water supply. The sum of these two items may differ from the water production figures by the amount of water received from or supplied to other organisations. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are premises and equipment (facilities) serving for wastewater treatment and having the mechanical, biological, and/or other stage of treatment. Equipment for wastewater pre-treatment (rakes, sand traps, oil traps, grit traps, etc.), cesspools, sumps, and simple facilities with a mechanical function, which are not regularly observed and operated, are not considered to be wastewater treatment plants.

The capacity of WWTPs is given as the designed capacity in m³/day. A higher capacity than the designed one is given when implemented intensification measures have been approved by the water management authority. The data listed in the Tables 3-24 through 3-31 have been obtained from the processing of the CZSO's questionnaires filled in by watercourse management organisations and operators of water supply and sewerage systems. Data on water supply and sewerage systems have been obtained from a regular survey among major operators and a sample of municipalities. Then they are grossed up to Regions and the whole Czech Republic.

Tables 3-32 to 3-37 Investments, non-investment expenditure, and economic benefits from environmental protection activities. Environmental protection is divided into nine areas as follows:
Protection of ambient air and climate includes modifications to technological processes to prevent pollution (air pollution control, protection of climate and the ozone layer); removal of waste gases and vented air; removal of solid and gaseous emissions; air quality monitoring systems, etc. Wastewater management includes modifications to technological processes to prevent pollution; construction of wastewater treatment plants; construction of sewerage systems connected to wastewater treatment plants; cooling water management; water quality monitoring systems, etc. Waste management includes modifications to technological processes to prevent waste generation; facilities and equipment for waste collection, transport, sorting, and treatment; construction of incineration plants, recycling plants, controlled landfills, and composting plants; remediation of old landfills; waste monitoring systems, etc.

Protection of biodiversity and landscapes includes protection and rehabilitation of habitats and species; protection of natural and nature-close types of landscape; protection and renewal of components of ecological stability; revitalization of hydrological network; costs of solutions to duties resulting from the Act No 44/1988 Sb, on the Protection and Utilisation of Mineral Resources (the Mining Act), as subsequently amended, etc. Protection and remediation of soil, groundwater and surface water involves prevention of pollutants’ deposition into soil including subsequent infiltration into water; prevention of soil contamination and degradation by chemical effects and subsequent soil remediation; protection of soil against erosion, slope slides and other degradation caused by physical phenomena, including costs of solutions of landslide issues; costs of geological survey tasks aimed at protection of soil, groundwater and surface water, etc.

Noise and vibration abatement (excluding workplace protection) includes prevention of noise and vibration through technology and design modifications and application of noise and vibration control systems in transport by road, rail, and air and in industry; measuring equipment, etc. Protection against radiation includes radon control measures; geological work connected with the issue of locating deep nuclear waste depositories; measuring equipment; transport and handling of highly radioactive waste, etc. Research and development include R&D activities dealing with air pollution control and protection of climate and the ozone layer; water pollution control; waste management; soil and groundwater protection; noise and vibration abatement; biodiversity conservation and landscape protection; radiological protection; other environmental research and development, etc. Other environmental protection activities involve acquisition of long-term tangible fixed assets to prevent floods, environmental protection education, training and instructing, etc. Data given in the tables come from annual questionnaires of the CZSO.

Table 3-39 Income and expenditure of the State Environmental Fund of the Czech Republic
The income of the State Environmental Fund of the Czech Republic (SEF CR) consists of various payments and charges plus resources from the National Programme of Air Pollution Control. Expenditure of the SEF CR includes grants and loans. From 2009 onwards, the Fund has been receiving income from the Green Savings programme (the Czech Green Investment Scheme, GIS), from the sale of emission permits (also called carbon credits). These are earmarked funds for implementation of measures leading to energy savings and utilisation of renewable energy sources in family houses and multi-dwelling buildings. Data in the Tables 3-38 and 3-39 were provided by the State Environmental Fund and the Ministry of Finance.

Table 3-40 Selected material flow indicators
Most environmental problems are directly or indirectly connected with the material flows through the economy. The compilation of macroeconomic material flow accounts objective is to quantify total material intensity of the economy. This intensity can be expressed as material inputs into the economy, material consumption, or as total waste flows from the economy back to the environment. Direct material input (DMI) measures the input of materials used by the economy, i.e. all materials, which are of economic value and are used in the production and consumption activities. DMI equals domestic (used) extraction (extracted raw materials and grown biomass) plus imports. Domestic material consumption (DMC) measures the total amount of materials directly used by the economy. DMC is calculated as DMI minus exports. Furthermore, economic performance indicators can be related to the input or output material flow indicators. For example, GDP per DMI or DMC unit indicate direct material productivity of the economy. Conversely, input indicators related to GDP give material intensity of the economy. The material flow indicators of the Czech Republic were subdivided into the following categories: – biomass (raw materials, intermediates, semi-finished products, and products of biomass); – fossil fuels (raw materials, intermediates, semi-finished products, and products of fossil fuels); – metal ores (raw materials, intermediates, semi-finished products, and products of metal ores); – non-metallic minerals (raw materials, intermediates, semi-finished products, and products of industrial and construction minerals); – other (other products not elsewhere classified and wastes).

Obyvatelstvo (Population) je klíčovým ukazatelem pro analýzu demografických trendů a rozvoje měst. V České republice se populace v posledních letech vyvíjí různými směry, což má vliv na ekonomiku, sociální strukturu a plánování městských služeb.

V roce 2022 byla populace České republiky odhadována na přibližně 10,5 milionu obyvatel. Tento údaj ukazuje na mírný nárůst v porovnání s předchozími lety, kdy se populace stabilizovala po období poklesu.

Důležité je také sledovat věkovou strukturu obyvatelstva, která se mění v důsledku stárnutí populace a migrace. Mladší generace se často stěhuje do větších měst za pracovními příležitostmi, což ovlivňuje demografické složení v různých regionech.

Obyvatelstvo
Population
Metodické vysvětlivky
Údaje o počtu a složení obyvatel se získávají ze sčítání lidu (zhruba v desetiletých intervalech) a z údajů o pohybu obyvatelstva a jejich bilancí. Tyto údaje vycházejí ze zpracování statistických hlášení o sňatcích, narozeních a úmrtích, poskytovaných matričními úřady, a ze zpracování dat přebíraných z jiných informačních systémů. Zdrojem dat o rozvodech je informační systém Ministerstva spravedlnosti, údaje o potratech a příčinách smrti (uvedených na Listu o prohlídce zemřelého) poskytuje ČSÚ Ústav zdravotnických informací a statistiky ČR (ÚZIS ČR), data o stěhování přebírá ČSÚ z informačních systémů Ministerstva vnitra a Ředitelství služby cizinecké policie. Rozdíly ve středním stavu obyvatelstva mezi roky 1990–1991, 2000–2001, 2010–2011 a 2020–2021 vyplývají z rozdílů mezi sčítáními lidu a každoročními bilancemi.

Poznámky k tabulkám
Od 1. května 2004 se veškeré údaje týkají občanů České republiky a cizinců s trvalým pobytem v České republice, občanů třetích zemí s přechodným pobytem na území České republiky na základě dlouhodobého víza (nad 90 dnů) nebo povolení k dlouhodobému pobytu, občanů zemí EU, Norska, Švýcarska, Islandu, Lichtenštejnska a jejich rodinných příslušníků s hlášeným přechodným pobytem na území České republiky a cizinců s udělenou mezinárodní ochranou v České republice; od roku 2022 také osob s udělenou dočasnou ochranou v České republice s obvyklým pobytem v Česku. Do roku 2000 se údaje týkaly pouze obyvatel s trvalým bydlištěm v České republice (bez ohledu na jejich státní občanství), od roku 2001 v návaznosti na Sčítání lidu, domů a bytů 2001 nově i cizinců s vízy k pobytu nad 90 dnů a cizinců s azylem. Údaje zohledňují rovněž události (sňatky, narození a úmrtí) českých občanů s trvalým pobytem na území České republiky, ke kterým došlo v zahraničí, a byly zaregistrovány v České republice v termínu, který umožnil jejich zařazení do statistiky. Ve všech tabulkách se věkem rozumí dokončený věk, tj. věk při posledních narozeninách, s výjimkou tabulky 4-19.

Střední stav obyvatel je definován jako stav k 1. červenci daného roku. Přirozený přírůstek/úbytek je rozdíl mezi počtem živě narozených dětí a počtem zemřelých osob. Přírůstek/úbytek stěhováním je rozdíl mezi počtem přistěhovalých a vystěhovalých osob.

Tab. 4-7 První sňatky podle věku ženicha a nevěsty
Úhrnná sňatečnost svobodných udává podíl mužů, resp. žen (v %), kteří by uzavřeli první sňatek před dosažením 50 let věku za předpokladu, že by míry sňatečnosti, úmrtnosti a migrace svobodných zaznamenané ve sledovaném kalendářním roce zůstaly neměnné. Je výsledným ukazatelem jednovýchodných tabulek sňatečnosti svobodných. Průměrný věk při prvním sňatku vychází z rozložení intenzit sňatečnosti podle věku.

Tab. 4-11 až 4-14 Narození a potraty
Zákon č. 372/2011 Sb., o zdravotních službách, ve znění pozdějších předpisů, definuje plod po potratu, jímž se rozumí plod, který po úplném vypuzení nebo vynětí z těla matčina neprojevuje ani jednu ze známek života a současně jeho porodní hmotnost je nižší než 500 g, a pokud ji nelze zjistit, jestliže je těhotenství kratší než 22 týdny. Všechny případy potratu, spolu s definicemi živě a mrtvě narozeného dítěte, jsou uvedeny v pokynech k vyplnění Listu o prohlídce zemřelého (ve vyhlášce č. 297/2012 Sb., o Listu o prohlídce zemřelého, ve znění pozdějších předpisů), a to pro potřeby vyplnění tohoto listu. Údaje ČSÚ o počtech živě a mrtvě narozených dětí vychází z položky „vitalita“ narozeného dítěte vyplněné na hlášení o narození; dodržení definice se předpokládá. V období od 1. března 1988 do 31. března 2012 definovala narození živého dítěte vyhláška Ministerstva zdravotnictví č. 11/1988 Sb., o povinném hlášení ukončení těhotenství, úmrtí dítěte a úmrtí matky, jako jeho úplné vypuzení nebo vynětí z těla matčina, jestliže dítě projevovalo alespoň jednu ze známek života a mělo porodní hmotnost: a) 500 g a vyšší, nebo b) nižší než 500 g, přežilo-li 24 hodin po porodu. Známkami života se rozuměl dech nebo akce srdeční nebo pulsace pupečníku nebo aktivní pohyb svalstva, i když pupečník nebyl přerušen nebo placenta nebyla porozena. Narozením mrtvého dítěte se rozumělo úplné vypuzení nebo vynětí z těla matčina, jestliže plod neprojevil ani jednu ze známek života a měl porodní hmotnost 1 000 g a vyšší. Potratem se rozumělo ukončení těhotenství ženy, při němž: a) plod neprojevil ani jednu ze známek života a jeho porodní hmotnost byla nižší než 1 000 g a pokud ji nešlo zjistit, jestliže těhotenství bylo kratší než 28 týdnů.

b) plod projevoval alespoň jednu ze známek života a měl porodní hmotnost nižší než 500 g, ale nepřežil 24 hodin po porodu;
c) z dělohy ženy bylo vyňato plodové vejce bez plodu, anebo těhotenská sliznice.
V období od 1. ledna 1965 do 29. února 1988 platily v České republice mezinárodně doporučené definice dítěte, podle kterých:
narození živého plodu je vypuzení nebo úplné vynětí plodu z těla matčina (bez ohledu na délku těhotenství), jestliže plod po
narození dýchá nebo projevuje jiné známky života, jako srdeční činnost, pulzaci pupečníku nebo aktivní pohyb svalstva, i když
pupečník nebyl přerušen nebo placenta porozena; narození mrtvého plodu je narození plodu, jehož úmrtí nastalo před úplným
vypuzením nebo vynětím z těla matčina (bez ohledu na délku těhotenství). Úmrtí je prokázáno tím, že plod nedýchá ani
neprojevuje jinou známku života, jako srdeční činnost, pulzaci pupečníku nebo aktivní pohyb svalstva (vyhláška ministerstva
zdravotnictví č. 194/1964 Sb., o povinném hlášení živě a mrtvě narozeného plodu, úmrtí dítěte do sedmi dnů po porodu a úmrtí
matky). Za mrtvě narozené dítě je považován plod narozený po 28. týdnu těhotenství nebo, nelze-li délku určit, vážící alespoň
1 000 g. Za potrat se považuje každý mrtvě narozený plod narozený do 28. týdne těhotenství nebo (nelze-li délku těhotenství
určit) který vážil méně než 1 000 g.

In the fertility and abortion rates table (Tab. 4-14 Míry plodnosti a potratovosti), the fertility rate by age indicates the number of live births per 1000 women of childbearing age in a specific age group. The total fertility rate represents the average number of live births that would occur to a woman if the age-specific fertility rates observed in the calendar year remained constant throughout her reproductive years (15–49 years). The average age of women at childbirth is derived from the distribution of age-specific fertility rates.

In the fertility and abortion rates table, the spontaneous abortion rate by age indicates the number of spontaneous abortions per 1000 women of childbearing age in a specific age group. The total spontaneous abortion rate reflects the average number of spontaneous abortions that would occur to a woman if the age-specific spontaneous abortion rates observed in the calendar year remained unchanged during her reproductive years (15–49 years). The average age of women at spontaneous abortion is based on the distribution of age-specific spontaneous abortion rates.

In the fertility and abortion rates table, the induced abortion rate by age indicates the number of induced abortions (artificial terminations of pregnancy) per 1000 women of childbearing age in a specific age group. The total induced abortion rate expresses the average number of induced abortions that would occur to a woman if the age-specific induced abortion rates recorded in the calendar year remained constant throughout her reproductive years (15–49 years). The average age of women at induced abortion is derived from the distribution of age-specific induced abortion rates.

In the mortality causes table (Tab. 4-16 a 4-17 Zemřelí podle příčiny smrti), data on causes of death are derived from the Death Examination Report (List o prohlídce zemřelého, LPZ), and since 2013, through the Czech Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS ČR). The Czech Statistical Office selects the underlying cause of death from the causes listed on the LPZ for tabulation purposes. Since 2011, this selection has been performed using an automated coding program (IRIS). Causes of death are reported according to the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) and its updates published by the World Health Organization (WHO). The ICD-10 has been used in the Czech Republic since data for the year 1994, with the translation of the ICD into Czech and the implementation of updates managed by ÚZIS ČR.

In the stillbirth and child mortality rates table (Tab. 4-18 Mrtvorozenost a míry úmrtnosti dětí do 1 roku věku), perinatal mortality includes stillborn children and infants who die at ages 0–6 days. Early mortality indicates the number of children who die at ages 0–6 days per 1000 live births. Neonatal mortality indicates the number of children who die at ages 0–27 days per 1000 live births. Post-neonatal mortality indicates the number of children who die from 28 days to the end of the first year of life per 1000 live births. Infant mortality indicates the number of children who die before reaching the age of 1 year per 1000 live births. Stillbirth indicates the number of stillborn children per 1000 all births. Perinatal mortality indicates the number of stillborn children and infants who die at ages 0–6 days per 1000 all births.

Population
Methodological notes
Data on the size and structure of the population are derived from population censuses (approximately at decennial intervals) and from data on population changes and their balances. These data come from the processing of statistical reports on marriages, births, and deaths provided by registry offices and from the processing of data obtained from other information systems. The information system of the Ministry of Justice is the source of data on divorces. The data on abortions and causes of death (stated on the “Death certificate (Report on examination of the deceased person)”) are provided to the CZSO by the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the CR (IHIS CR). The data on migration the CZSO obtains from information systems of the Ministry of the Interior and the Directorate of the Foreign Police Service. Differences in the mid-year population figures for the years 1990–1991, 2000–2001, 2010–2011, and 2020–2021 are due to differences between results of the relevant population and housing censuses and annual population balances.

Notes on Tables
Since 1 May 2004, all data refer to citizens of the Czech Republic and foreigners with permanent residence in the Czech Republic, third-country nationals with temporary residence in the territory of the Czech Republic based on a long-term visa (over 90 days) or a long-term residence permit, nationals of the EU Member States, Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein and their family members with notified temporary residence in the territory of the Czech Republic and foreigners with international protection granted in the Czech Republic; since 2022, they also refer to persons with temporary protection granted in the Czech Republic with usual residence in Czechia.

Before 2001, data only referred to the population with permanent residence in the Czech Republic (irrespective of their citizenship). Since 2001, following the 2001 Population and Housing Census, the data have also newly included foreigners with a visa for stay over 90 days and foreigners with asylum status.

The data also include events (marriages, births, and deaths) of Czech citizens with the permanent residence in the Czech Republic that occurred abroad and were registered in the Czech Republic within a period that allowed their inclusion into the statistics.

In all tables, the age means a completed age, i.e. the age at the last birthday, with the exception of the Table 4-19.

Table 4-1 Vital statistics
The mid-year population is defined as the population as at 1 July of the reference year. The natural change or natural population change is the number of live births minus the number of deaths. The net migration is the difference between the number of immigrants and emigrants.

Table 4-7 First marriages by age of groom and bride
The total first marriage rate is the proportion of males/females (in %) who would enter into the first marriage before their 50th birthday provided that age-specific marriage, mortality, and migration rates of single population of a reference year remained unchanged. It is the main output indicator of one-decrement nuptiality life tables. The mean age at first marriage is based on the distribution of marriage intensities by age.

Tables 4-11 to 4-14 Births and abortions
The Act No 372/2011 Sb, on Health Services, as subsequently amended, defines a foetus after abortion that is a foetus, which after the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother shows no evidence of life and at the same time its birth weight is lower than 500 g and provided that the weight cannot be measured, if the pregnancy lasted less than 22 weeks. All types of abortion along with the definitions of a live birth and a stillbirth are stated in the guidelines for filling in the “Death certificate (Report on examination of the deceased person)” (in the Decree No 297/2012 Sb, on the Death certificate (Report on examination of the deceased person), as subsequently amended), namely for the needs of filling in the Death certificate. Data of the CZSO on numbers of live births and stillbirths are based on this kind of information stated in the report on birth; the compliance with the definition is assumed.

In the period from 1 March 1988 to 31 March 2012, a live birth was defined by the Decree of the Ministry of Health No 11/1988 Sb, on mandatory notifications of terminated pregnancies, death of a child, and death of the mother, as the complete expulsion or extraction of a child from its mother provided that the child showed at least one evidence of life and its birth weight was: a) 500 g or more, or b) lower than 500 g, if it lived the first 24 hours after birth. The evidences of life were: breathing or beating of the heart or pulsation of the umbilical cord, or movement of voluntary muscles, although the umbilical cord had not been cut or the placenta had not been delivered.

Obyvatelstvo
Population
A stillbirth was understood as the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a foetus that showed no evidence of life and its birth weight was 1 000 g or more. An abortion was understood as the termination of a pregnancy of a woman, at which: a) the foetus showed no evidence of life and its birth weight was below 1 000 g and in case the weight could not be measured, if the pregnancy lasted less than 28 weeks; b) the foetus showed at least one evidence of life and its birth weight was below 500 g, but it did not survive the first 24 hours after birth; c) the foetal egg without a foetus or decidua was removed out of the mother’s uterus. In the period from 1 January 1965 to 29 February 1988, internationally recommended definitions of a child were valid in the Czech Republic, according to which: a birth of a live foetus (a live-born foetus) is a complete expulsion or extraction of a foetus from its mother (regardless the length of the pregnancy) provided that the foetus after the delivery is breathing or shows other evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or movement of voluntary muscles, although the umbilical cord had not been cut or the placenta had not been delivered; a birth of a dead foetus (a stillborn foetus) is a birth of a foetus that died prior to the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother (regardless the length of the pregnancy). The death is indicated by the fact that the foetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles (the Decree of the Ministry of Health No 194/1964 Sb, on mandatory notifications of a live-born and a stillborn foetus, death of a child within seven days of birth, and death of the mother). A foetus born after 28 weeks of pregnancy or, when the duration of pregnancy cannot be determined, a foetus weighting at least 1 000 g is considered to be a stillborn child. Every stillborn foetus born before the 28th week of pregnancy or (when the duration of pregnancy cannot be determined) a foetus that weighted less than 1 000 g is considered to be an abortion.

In the fertility and abortion rates table (Tabulka 4-14 Fertilita a míra potratů), the age-specific fertility rate indicates the number of live births to women in a particular age group per 1000 mid-year population of women in that age group. The total fertility rate expresses the mean number of children that would be born alive to a woman provided that age-specific fertility rates recorded in a reference calendar year remained unchanged during her childbearing period (age 15–49 years). The mean age of women at childbirth is based on the distribution of age-specific fertility rates. The age-specific spontaneous abortion rate shows the number of spontaneous abortions of women in a particular age group per 1000 mid-year population of women in that age group. The total spontaneous abortion rate expresses the average number of spontaneous abortions that a woman would have provided that age-specific spontaneous abortion rates recorded in a reference calendar year remained unchanged during her childbearing period (age 15–49 years). The mean age of women at spontaneous abortion is based on the distribution of age-specific spontaneous abortion rates. The age-specific induced abortion rate shows the number of induced abortions of women in a particular age group per 1000 mid-year population of women in that age group. The total legally induced abortion rate expresses the average number of induced abortions that a woman would have provided that age-specific induced abortion rates recorded in a reference calendar year remained unchanged during her childbearing period (age 15–49 years). The mean age of women at induced abortion is based on the distribution of age-specific induced abortion rates.

In the deaths by cause of death table (Tabulka 4-16 a 4-17 Úmrtí podle příčiny úmrtí), data on causes of death are obtained from the “Death certificate (Report on examination of the deceased person),” from 2013 through the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the CR (IHIS CR). From the causes of death stated in the Report on examination of the deceased person, the Czech Statistical Office selects the underlying cause of death that is used for tabulations. Since 2011, selection of the underlying cause of death has been made by the programme for automated coding (IRIS). Causes of death have been coded according to the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) and its updates issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). The ICD-10 is used in the CR since data for the year 1994. The IHIS CR is responsible for translation of the ICD-10 to Czech and for implementation of its updates.

Table 4-19 Life expectancy by age and sex
The life expectancy shows the average number of years an x-year-old individual can expect to live, given the mortality conditions of the reference period. It is a main indicator of mortality life tables reflecting mortality conditions in a given year.

Table 4-20 Internal migration by type of migration and age of the migrant
The internal migration refers to a change of the municipality of permanent residence, as for foreigners, it also refers to a change of the municipality of other types of residence exceeding 90 days, within the territory of the Czech Republic. All data reflect the territorial breakdown of the Czech Republic valid as at 1 January of the year data refer to.

Tables 4-21 and 4-22 International migration
The international migration refers to a change of the country of permanent residence; as for foreigners, it also refers to a change of the country of other types of residence exceeding 90 days. The table shows 45 countries with the highest number of immigrants during the last year.

Tables 4-23 and 4-24 Foreigners in the Czech Republic
Pursuant to the Act No 326/1999 Sb, on the Residence of Foreigners in the Territory of the Czech Republic and amending certain acts, such a person is deemed a foreigner, who lacks Czech citizenship, including a national of the EU. The acquisition and loss of citizenship of the Czech Republic is governed by the Act No 186/2013 Sb, on Citizenship of the Czech Republic. The act became effective on 1 January 2014. Besides other changes brought by the act, it allows e.g. dual or multiple citizenship. On 6 September 2019, an amendment of the Act on Citizenship of the Czech Republic came into force pursuant to which it is newly possible for children and grandchildren of former Czechoslovak and Czech citizens to acquire citizenship of the Czech Republic by declaration.

The entry to the territory of the Czech Republic, residence in it, and departure from it fall within the competence of the Police of the CR, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Foreigners may reside in the territory of the Czech Republic temporarily or permanently. The tables contain the following categories of foreigners:

Národní účty (National accounts) jsou součástí ekonomické statistiky, která se zaměřuje na sledování a analýzu ekonomických aktivit v zemi. Tyto účty poskytují důležité informace o celkovém hospodářském výkonu, včetně hrubého domácího produktu (HDP), příjmů a výdajů domácností, investic a obchodní bilance.

Národní účty jsou klíčové pro formulaci hospodářské politiky a pro analýzu ekonomických trendů. Umožňují vládám a institucím lépe porozumět dynamice ekonomiky a přijímat informovaná rozhodnutí.
[/X][P]NO_CONTENT_HERE[P][X]
Národní účty (National accounts) sestavované v České republice jsou založeny na evropském standardu ESA 2010 (nařízení Evropského parlamentu a Rady (EU) č. 549/2013, o evropském systému národních a regionálních účtů v Evropské unii) a řadě doplňujících a upřesňujících nařízení. Základní kostru českých národních účtů tvoří soustava sektorových/subsektorových účtů (sestavovaných v roční a čtvrtletní periodicity). Na ně navazují další tabulky a bilance, zejména tabulky dodávek a užití a bilance nefinančních aktiv nebo podrobný přehled daňových příjmů a příjmů ze sociálních příspěvků.

V sektorových účtech jsou zachyceny veškeré materiální, důchodové, peněžní a ostatní toky mezi všemi ekonomickými subjekty uvnitř národní ekonomiky i ve vztahu k zahraničí, a zároveň i výsledky těchto toků. Zachycení tak složitého ekonomického mechanismu, jako je národní ekonomika v komplexní a přitom relativně jednoduché podobě, je umožněno seskupením všech ekonomických subjektů uvnitř národního hospodářství do několika skupin podle jejich převažující role v ekonomice (do tzv. institucionálních sektorů).

Institucionální sektory (Institutional sectors) Národní účty popisují ekonomický proces v rozdělení podle institucionálních sektorů a subsektorů. Každý sektor (subsektor) se skládá z jednotek, které mají podobné základní činnosti, funkce a ekonomické chování a patří ke stejnému typu výrobce. Každá jednotka je zatříděna pouze do jednoho sektoru/subsektoru (bez ohledu na její právní formu). Mezi rezidentské institucionální sektory, které tvoří národní hospodářství (S.1) patří:

– nefinanční podniky (S.11), jejichž základní činností je výroba výrobků a poskytování nefinančních služeb; jsou to např. zemědělské, průmyslové, stavební nebo dopravní podniky, školy nebo zdravotnická zařízení (akciové společnosti, družstva, státní podniky atd.);

– finanční instituce (S.12), jejichž základní činností je finanční zprostředkování, nebo finanční pomocná činnost; jsou to např. banky, úvěrní družstva, fondy peněžního trhu, investiční fondy, finančně leasingové společnosti, kaptivní společnosti (např. holdingové finanční společnosti), pomocné finanční instituce (burzy nebo investiční společnosti), pojišťovny a penzijní fondy;

– vládní instituce (S.13), jejichž produkce je určena pro individuální a kolektivní spotřebu, a které jsou financovány zejména povinnými platbami od jednotek z jiných sektorů; jsou to organizační složky státu (např. ministerstva, ústřední úřady a jimi řízené organizace), mimorozpočtové fondy, a jiné ústřední instituce, územní samosprávné celky (kraje, obce, města, a dobrovolné svazky obcí), příspěvkové organizace a fondy sociálního zabezpečení (zdravotní pojišťovny spravující všeobecné zdravotní pojištění); jsou zde i neziskové instituce a nefinanční a finanční korporace pojímané jako netržní jednotky a zatříděné v S.13 v souladu s kvalitativními a kvantitativními kritérii ESA 2010;

– domácnosti (S.14) zahrnující jednotlivce nebo skupiny jednotlivců jako konečné spotřebitele a drobné podnikatele produkující tržní výrobky a služby (řemeslníky, samostatně hospodařící zemědělce, soukromé lékaře, advokáty, daňové poradce apod.) a společenství vlastníků jednotek;

– neziskové instituce sloužící domácnostem (S.15), které jsou netržními výrobci; jsou to politické strany, církevní a náboženské společnosti, nadace, odborové svazy, profesní a vzdělávací společnosti, zájmové nebo dobročinné organizace aj.

Národní účty popisují také ekonomické operace s nerezidenty, tj. jednotkami, které sídlí mimo ekonomické území České republiky alespoň jeden rok nebo déle. Nerezidenti (S.2) představují seskupení jednotek (bez ohledu na charakteristiku jejich funkcí a zdrojů), které je rozděleno na členské státy a instituce EU a státy mimo EU. Jsou to např. zastupitelské úřady cizích států nebo mezinárodní organizace, které byly založeny a fungují na základě mezinárodních dohod, nebo oddělené části mateřských společností (např. pobočky výrobních podniků, bank a pojišťovacích společností). Údaje za nerezidenty se nezahrnují do položek za národní hospodářství celkem (S.1).

V každém institucionálním sektoru jsou v českých národních účtech všechny produkční jednotky seskupeny i podle charakteru jejich převažující činnosti do odvětví. Pro odvětvové zařazení každé produkční jednotky se používá Klasifikace ekonomických činností (CZ-NACE), která je českou verzí standardní klasifikace EU (NACE Rev. 2).

Posloupnost účtů (Sequence of accounts) Dalším charakteristickým rysem národních účtů je seskupení všech tokových a stavových veličin podle jejich ekonomického charakteru a jejich uspořádání do systému účtů a tabulek. Obecné principy uspořádání a zápisů jsou v národním účetnictví v podstatě podobné obecným principům známým z podnikového účetnictví. Každý z účtů systému je vybilancovaný. Vyplývá to buď z definice účtů (účet výrobků a služeb), anebo je použita vyrovnávací (bilanční) položka, která se pak přenáší do dalšího účtu. Bilanční položky jsou v účtech zachycovány buď čisté, nebo hrubé. Rozdíl v obou pojetích je tvořen spotřebou fixního kapitálu. Účet výrobků a služeb se sestavuje pouze za národní hospodářství jako celek, zatímco všechny ostatní účty se sestavují za jednotlivé institucionální sektory a subsektory, a samozřejmě i za národní hospodářství jako celek.

Účet výrobků a služeb zobrazuje, jak jsou celkové zdroje (produkce, dovoz a čisté daně z produktů) za národní hospodářství jako celek použity (pro mezispotřebu, konečnou spotřebu, tvorbu kapitálu a pro vývoz).
[/X][P][X]
Národní účty (National accounts) zachycují objem zdrojů v rovnováze s jejich užitím. Vzhledem k tomu, že v tomto účtu jsou zachyceny toky zboží a služeb, které mají v ekonomice opačný směr než toky peněz za ně vydané, jsou zde zdroje a užití zobrazeny na opačných stranách, než je tomu u účtů sektorových.

Běžné účty zachycují tvorbu, rozdělení a přerozdělení důchodů a jejich užití pro konečnou spotřebu. Výslednou vyrovnávací položkou jsou úspory (B.8), které jsou nově vytvořeným zdrojem pro akumulaci. Mezi běžné účty patří: účet produkce, účet tvorby důchodů, účet prvotního rozdělení důchodů (dále rozčleněný na účet podnikatelských důchodů a účet rozdělení ostatních prvotních důchodů), účet druhotného rozdělení důchodů, účet přerozdělení naturálních důchodů a účet užití důchodů. Účet užití důchodů má v soustavě podobu dvou obsahově odlišných účtů – účtu užití disponibilních důchodů a účtu užití upravených disponibilních důchodů.

Účty akumulace zobrazují u každého sektoru změny objemu i ocenění jednotlivých složek jeho aktiv a závazků. Celá sestava akumulačních účtů je tvořena těmito účty: kapitálový účet (členěný na účet změn čistého jmění vlivem úspor a kapitálových transferů a účet pořízení nefinančních aktiv), finanční účet a účty ostatních změn aktiv (členěné na účet ostatních změn objemu aktiv a účty přecenění – účty nominálního, neutrálního a reálného zisku z držby).

Rozvahové účty zachycují hodnoty aktiv a závazků, které jsou v určitý moment (k počátku a ke konci kalendářního roku, nebo čtvrtletí) v držení daného sektoru či subsektoru a změny v rozvaze. Vyrovnávací položkou je čisté jmění (B.90), které v úhrnu za národní hospodářství představuje národní bohatství, tj. veškerá nefinanční a finanční aktiva po odpočtu finančních závazků ve vztahu k nerezidentům. Význam rozvahy pro celý systém národních účtů je především v tom, že završuje posloupnost účtů, neboť zobrazuje konečný výsledek zápisů v běžných a v akumulačních účtech. Mezi rozvahové účty patří: počáteční rozvaha, změny v rozvaze a konečná rozvaha.

Účty nerezidentů slouží pro zachycení transakcí mezi rezidentskými a nerezidentskými jednotkami (co je zdrojem pro nerezidenty, je pro rezidenty nákladem). Posloupnost účtů je obdobná jako u účtů rezidentských institucionálních sektorů, tj. účet výrobků a služeb nerezidentů, účet prvotních důchodů a běžných transferů nerezidentů, účty akumulace nerezidentů (členěné na kapitálový a finanční účet nerezidentů, účet ostatních změn aktiv nerezidentů, tj. účet ostatních změn objemu aktiv nerezidentů a účet přecenění) a rozvahy nerezidentů.

Účty nerezidentů zachycují toky a stavy mezi nerezidenty a rezidenty, nezachycují tedy vztahy mezi nerezidenty navzájem, tj. nevyjadřují souhrn ostatního světa. V české praxi je proto používáno stejné podrobné členění jednotlivých toků a stavů v účtech jako u rezidentských sektorů, včetně podrobného členění účtů akumulace a rozvahových účtů.

Každý ukazatel (transakce, ostatní toky a stavy) je v národních účtech označen kódem, který je v souladu s mezinárodním standardem ESA 2010, nebo z něj vychází. Transakce s výrobky a službami se označují kódem P (s nevyráběnými aktivy NP), rozdělovací transakce kódem D, vyrovnávací položky kódem Bg (v hrubém pojetí včetně spotřeby fixního kapitálu) nebo Bn (v čistém pojetí – po vyloučení spotřeby fixního kapitálu), transakce s finančními nástroji kódem F a ostatní změny aktiv, závazků a čistého jmění kódem K. Stavy nefinančních aktiv uváděné v počáteční a konečné rozvaze se označují kódem AN a stavy finančních aktiv včetně ostatních pohledávek a závazků se označují kódem AF. Podrobnější členění standardních položek národních účtů je doplněno kódem X, např. XAF. Alfabetické kódy jsou doplněny číselnými kódy, např. B.1g, nebo AF.89.

ESA 2010 obsahují také funkční klasifikace: COFOG (Klasifikace funkcí vládních institucí), COPNI (Klasifikace služeb neziskových institucí sloužících domácnostem podle účelu), COICOP (Klasifikace individuální spotřeby podle účelu), nebo NACE Rev. 2 pro ekonomické činnosti a CPA 2015 pro produkty podle ekonomických činností.

Produkce výrobků a služeb (P.1) představuje hodnotu tržních i netržních výrobků a služeb, které jsou výsledkem produkční činnosti rezidentských jednotek v daném období na území České republiky. Tvoří ji:
– tržní produkce (P.11), která obsahuje zejména tržby z prodeje výrobků a služeb vlastní výroby, obchodní rozpětí a změnu stavu nedokončené výroby a výrobků;
– produkce pro vlastní konečné užití (P.12), tj. netržní produkce, kterou si jednotka ponechává pro svou tvorbu kapitálu nebo pro vlastní konečnou spotřebu. Obsahuje zejména aktivaci výrobků a služeb, zemědělskou produkci domácností pro vlastní spotřebu, individuální bytovou výstavbu domácností a imputované nájemné domácností bydlících ve vlastních domech a bytech;
– ostatní netržní produkce (P.13) je součtem netržní produkce poskytované za ekonomicky nevýznamné ceny (P.131 – platby za netržní produkci) a netržní produkce poskytované zdarma (P.132 – ostatní netržní produkce). Bezplatná ostatní netržní produkce (P.132) je vyjádřena jako rozdíl mezi vynaloženými provozními náklady včetně čistých daní z výroby a dovozu vládních institucí a neziskových institucí sloužících domácnostem a jejich tržbami z prodeje výrobků a služeb (P.11+P.131) a produkcí pro vlastní konečné užití (P.12).

Mezispotřeba (P.2) představuje hodnotu výrobků a služeb (včetně FISIM) spotřebovaných v průběhu příslušného období rezidentskými výrobci v procesu výroby jiných výrobků a služeb. Výdaje na konečnou spotřebu (P.3) zahrnují výdaje na konečnou spotřebu domácností, vládních institucí a neziskových institucí sloužících domácnostem. Konečná spotřeba vyjadřuje hodnotu výrobků a služeb k uspokojení kolektivních a individuálních potřeb. Rozděluje se z hlediska úhrady (kdo převážně hradí) a z hlediska spotřebitele. Výdaje na konečnou spotřebu se dále člení na:

Národní účty
National accounts
– výdaje na individuální spotřebu (P.31), které jsou součtem výdajů na individuální spotřebu domácností, vládních a neziskových institucí. Výdaje domácností na individuální spotřebu zahrnují zejména nákupy výrobků a tržních služeb (včetně FISIM), služby bydlení (propočtené nájemné za domácnosti bydlící ve vlastních obydlích), hodnotu výrobků produkovaných domácnostmi pro vlastní spotřebu, např. ovoce nebo zeleninu; výrobky a služby poskytované zdarma nebo se slevou a nákupy českých turistů v zahraničí. Výdaje hrazené vládními institucemi jsou stanoveny podle odpovídajících vládních funkcí (COFOG). Výdaje neziskových institucí sloužících domácnostem na konečnou spotřebu jsou stanoveny ve výši jejich bezplatných netržních služeb a celé se považují za výdaje na individuální konečnou spotřebu;
– výdaje na kolektivní spotřebu (P.32) vládních institucí jsou stanoveny v rozsahu jejich výdajů na kolektivní spotřebu podle odpovídajících funkcí (COFOG).
Skutečná konečná spotřeba (P.4) představuje součet skutečné konečné spotřeby domácností (P.41, resp. součet výdajů domácností, vládních institucí a neziskových institucí sloužících domácnostem na individuální spotřebu) a skutečné konečné spotřeby vládních institucí (P.42, což je totožné s výdaji vládních institucí na kolektivní spotřebu). Úhrnná skutečná konečná spotřeba (P.4) je proto shodná s úhrnem všech výdajů na konečnou spotřebu (P.3).
Tvorba hrubého fixního kapitálu (P.51g) zahrnuje pořízení a úbytky fixních aktiv a zvýšení hodnoty nevyráběných nefinančních aktiv (P.511), náklady na převod nevyráběných nefinančních aktiv (P.512) a pořízení nevyráběných aktiv (NP). Pořízení fixních aktiv tvoří nákup nových nebo použitých fixních aktiv (včetně aktiv vytvořených ve vlastní režii), technické zhodnocení (rekonstrukce, modernizace, rekultivace půdy apod.), a bezúplatná nabytí stávajícího dlouhodobého majetku. Úbytky fixních aktiv představují prodeje a bezúplatná předání stávajícího dlouhodobého majetku. Součástí tvorby hrubého fixního kapitálu je i pořízení a úbytky vojenské techniky (které se promítaly v mezispotřebě a v konečné spotřebě vládních institucí v souladu s ESA95). Položka P.51g se sleduje v rozdělení podle typu fixních aktiv (byty, budovy a stavby, stroje a zařízení, zbraňové systémy aj.).
Změna zásob (P.52) představuje rozdíl mezi hodnotou přírůstků a úbytků zásob (včetně běžných ztrát na výrobcích) po vyloučení vlivu cenových změn a nahodilých událostí. Čisté pořízení cenností (P.53) představuje pořízení takového produktu, který není prvotně určen pro výrobu nebo spotřebu, za normálních podmínek se v průběhu času fyzicky neznehodnocuje a jeho majitel jej nabývá a drží hlavně za účelem uchování hodnot.
Vývoz (P.6) a dovoz (P.7) představuje hodnotu zboží a služeb směňovaných mezi rezidentskými a nerezidentskými jednotkami. Součástí dovozu je například i spotřeba českých občanů v cizině a naopak součástí vývozu je i spotřeba cizinců v České republice. Uvedené transakce jsou zachyceny v rozdělení na vývoz a dovoz zboží a vývoz a dovoz služeb a dále v rámci zemí EU a mimo země EU. Vývoz je zachycen v cenách FOB (cena na hranici vyvážející země) a dovoz je zachycen v cenách CIF (cena na hranici dovážející země) v tabulkách dodávek a užití a pro účely odhadu HDP. V sektorových účtech je vývoz i dovoz shodně zachycen v cenách FOB. Údaje o vývozu zahrnují také hodnotu FISIM.
Náhrady zaměstnancům (D.1) – peněžní i naturální, zahrnují mzdy a platy a sociální příspěvky placené zaměstnavatelem:
– mzdy a platy (D.11) představují celkové (peněžní a naturální) odměny zaměstnancům za jimi provedenou práci. Obsahují mzdy a platy za vykonanou práci pro zaměstnavatele, platy společníků firmy nebo členů družstev, dále platy a výdaje na uniformy vojáků z povolání, příspěvky věnované zaměstnancům na dopravu do práce a z práce, na stravování, na jejich kulturní nebo sportovní vyžití a jiné; zahrnují se i výrobky a služby poskytované zaměstnancům zdarma nebo za sníženou cenu. Uvádějí se před odpočtem daně z příjmu, zákonných (povinných) příspěvků na sociální a zdravotní pojištění, případně jiných srážek;
– sociální příspěvky zaměstnavatelů (D.12) placené zaměstnavatelem za jeho zaměstnance na všeobecné sociální a zdravotní pojištění, na penzijní a zdravotní připojištění, povinné úrazové pojištění (skutečné sociální příspěvky zaměstnavatelů) a přímé sociální podpory od zaměstnavatelů (nenávratné výpomoci hrazené např. ze sociálního fondu) a náhrada mzdy (nemocenské) hrazené zaměstnavatelem v období pracovní neschopnosti zaměstnanců, po dobu vymezenou zákonem (imputované sociální příspěvky). Položka D.12 se dále sleduje v rozdělení na příspěvky placené na penzijní pojištění zaměstnanců a ostatní sociální příspěvky.
Daně z výroby a dovozu (D.2) – nepřímé daně, zahrnují daně z produktů (např. daň z přidané hodnoty, cla, daně z dovozu, spotřební daně aj.) a ostatní daně z výroby (např. daně z nemovitých věcí, silniční daň, poplatky za znečištění vod a ovzduší aj.). Základem pro výpočet jsou údaje o daňových příjmech upravené metodou časového posunu, tj. odpovídající částka je posunuta do období, ve kterém vznikla daňová povinnost.
Dotace (D.3) – jsou jednostranné platby vládních nebo evropských institucí výrobcům. Člení se na dotace na produkty a ostatní dotace na výrobu:
– dotace na produkty (D.31) se poskytují na jednotku vyráběných výrobků a poskytovaných služeb; mají většinou charakter kompenzací ztrát ve výrobě a při poskytování služeb; jsou to např. dotace na zemědělské produkty, na osobní dopravu, nebo na teplo.
– ostatní dotace na výrobu (D.39) obsahují dotace podnikatelským subjektům a dotace podnikům, které zaměstnávají osoby se změněnou pracovní schopností – zejména dotace na úhradu běžné ztráty, nebo dotace na útlum těžby, nebo dotace na výrobu z fondů EU.
Čisté důchody z vlastnictví (D.4) vyjadřují saldo mezi přijatými a vydanými důchody z vlastnictví finančních a hmotných nevyráběných aktiv. Obsahují úroky (z vkladů, dluhových cenných papírů, půjček včetně finančního leasingu, upravené o hodnotu finančních služeb nepřímo měřených – FISIM), dividendy a podíly na zisku (s výjimkou superdividend), některé další.
[/X][P][X]
Národní účty
National accounts
důchody z rozděleného zisku a čerpání podnikatelského důchodu a pachtovné (rentu). Úroky ze swapových operací a operací
v rámci dohod o budoucích úrokových sazbách – FRA, se zachycují na finančním účtu. Superdividendy (např. zadržené
a vyplacené jednorázově za několik let) se zachycují na finančním účtu jako čerpání účastí jejich vlastníkem.
Běžné daně z důchodů, ze jmění aj. (D.5) zahrnují daně z příjmu a daň z kapitálových zisků (přímé daně) včetně daňových
doplatků a penále. Jsou to daně z příjmu fyzických a právnických osob, včetně daní z úroků, dividend, z osobních výher a loterií
nebo z nákupů a prodejů nemovitého majetku. Základem pro výpočet jsou údaje o daňových příjmech upravené metodou
časového posunu. Dále jsou zde zahrnuty některé správní poplatky (např. poplatky za psy nebo za povolení k vjezdu apod.).
Od ledna 2014 zahrnují daně z příjmu také příjmy z dědictví a darů (které není možné identifikovat). Daně z finančního majetku
nejsou v soustavě daní České republiky zavedeny.
Čisté sociální příspěvky (D.61)     – povinné i dobrovolné, se rozdělují podle plátců (placené zaměstnavatelem za své
zaměstnance    a domácnostmi,    tj. zaměstnanci, osobami  samostatně   výdělečně   činnými  a samoplátci)  a na  skutečné
a imputované sociální příspěvky. Skutečné sociální příspěvky zobrazují souhrnně všechny platby těm, kdo poskytují sociální
dávky, tj. příspěvky na povinné sociální, zdravotní a povinné úrazové pojištění a na penzijní připojištění. Imputované sociální
příspěvky jsou přímé sociální podpory od zaměstnavatelů. Tato druhá imputace vyplývá z potřeb vyrovnání vztahu k sociálním
dávkám. V rámci uvedených příspěvků se také vykazují penzijní a jiné než penzijní sociální příspěvky. Součástí sociálních
příspěvků je také platba za služby poskytované korporacemi, které sociální příspěvky spravují. Příjmy vládních institucí ze
sociálních příspěvků jsou upraveny metodou časového posunu.
Sociální dávky jiné než naturální sociální transfery (D.62) obsahují dávky vyplývající z účasti v programech sociálního
pojištění, tj. v rámci sociálního zabezpečení (všeobecného sociálního pojištění a povinného úrazového pojištění, které platí
zaměstnavatel za své zaměstnance) a penzijního připojištění. Dále jsou obsaženy peněžní sociální dávky hrazené obcemi
(z rozpočtu, mimo programy pojištění) v rámci péče o rodinu nebo o staré občany a náhrada mzdy (nemocenské) hrazená
zaměstnavatelem v období pracovní neschopnosti jejich zaměstnanců. Sociální dávky se sledují v rozdělení na dávky
z penzijního pojištění, ostatní dávky sociálního pojištění a sociální výpomocné dávky.
Naturální sociální transfery (D.63) jsou transfery domácnostem od vládních institucí nebo od neziskových institucí sloužících
domácnostem (NISD). Představují hodnotu výrobků a služeb poskytnutých zejména ve formě zdravotní a sociální péče,
vzdělání, bydlení. Jsou to zejména naturální dávky související se zdravotním pojištěním (platby za zdravotní pomůcky,
lékařské, zubní ošetření, operace apod.) hrazené zdravotními pojišťovnami těm, kdo toto zboží a služby poskytují. Dále jsou
zde obsaženy věcné dávky poskytované obcemi a hodnota výrobků a služeb v rozsahu výdajů vládních institucí a NISD na
individuální spotřebu. Naturální sociální dávky se dělí podle toho, zda odpovídající výrobky a služby byly vyrobeny jako netržní
produkce vládními institucemi a NISD nebo těmito jednotkami nakoupeny na trhu (včetně refundací schválených výdajů
domácností za určité druhy výrobků a služeb).
Ostatní běžné transfery (D.7) zahrnují platby neživotního pojištění a zajistné, náhrady z neživotního pojištění, platby uvnitř
sektoru vládních institucí, běžnou mezinárodní spolupráci a jiné běžné transfery. Neživotní pojištění je zachyceno jako čisté
pojistné (tj. pojistné snížené o hodnotu pojišťovacích služeb) a jako pojistné náhrady; nezahrnují se transakce související se
životním pojištěním, penzijním připojištěním ani se všeobecným sociálním a zdravotním pojištěním. Běžné transfery uvnitř
sektoru vládních institucí obsahují neinvestiční transfery mezi státním rozpočtem a rozpočty orgánů místních vládních institucí;
transfery mezi jednotkami stejného subsektoru sektoru vládních institucí jsou konsolidovány (např. mezi státním rozpočtem
a veřejnými vysokými školami). Běžná mezinárodní spolupráce představuje transfery mezi vládou České republiky a vládami
jiných  zemí  nebo  mezinárodními   organizacemi  (např. platby  v rámci Evropské   unie, OSN   nebo  dotace  z fondů  EU,
potravinovou pomoc, technickou pomoc a jinou výpomoc). Ostatní běžné transfery pak zahrnují běžné transfery pro neziskové
instituce sloužící domácnostem    (členské  příspěvky  a finanční podpory  politickým, odborovým,   církevním a podobným
institucím, platby na humanitární účely), běžné transfery mezi domácnostmi (finanční pomoci a dary od příbuzných a částky
výživného včetně soukromých mezinárodních transferů), a jiné transfery, které nebyly zahrnuty v předchozích položkách (např.
penále, pokuty ve správním a blokovém řízení, výhry, resp. sázky do výše výher, platby odškodného – sankční a regresní
náhrady apod.). Poslední podpoložka zahrnuje platby vládních institucí orgánům EU (tzv. vlastní zdroje EU odvozené z DPH
a HND).
Úpravy o změny penzijních nároků (D.8) je částka, o kterou se upravují disponibilní důchody domácností a penzijních fondů,
aby se vyrovnaly penzijní nároky domácností se změnami penzijních závazků („rezerv“) penzijních fondů ve finančním účtu.
Je stanovena jako rozdíl mezi přijatým pojistným a vyplacenými důchody. Životní pojištění domácností se v národních účtech
chápe jako úspora.
Kapitálové transfery (D.9)    jsou jednostranné transakce, které mají za následek změnu vlastnictví nefinančních nebo
finančních aktiv. Jsou to kapitálové daně (daně z dědictví a darovací daně), investiční dotace, resp. granty (např. z fondů EU)
a ostatní  kapitálové transfery, zejména  dědictví a dary  investičního charakteru,  restituční hmotné  i finanční náhrady,
bezúplatné převody majetku nebo transfery z titulu vyvolaných vládních garancí a odpuštění dluhu. Daně z dědictví a darů byly
(v ČR) koncem roku 2013 zrušeny a veškeré příjmy z dědictví a darů jsou od ledna roku 2014 součástí daně z příjmů.
Nefinanční aktiva (AN) zahrnují vyrobená (AN.1) a nevyráběná (AN.2) aktiva. Vyrobená aktiva (AN.1) se dále člení na fixní
aktiva (AN.11), zásoby (AN.12) a cennosti (AN.13).
Fixní aktiva (AN.11) zahrnují nefinanční (vyrobená) aktiva používaná ve výrobním procesu po dobu delší než jeden rok.
Zahrnují např. obydlí, ostatní budovy a stavby, stroje a zařízení, zbraňové systémy, pěstované biologické zdroje, náklady na
převod vlastnictví nevyráběných aktiv a produkty duševního vlastnictví.
Zásoby (AN.12) tvoří materiál a suroviny určené pro mezispotřebu, nedokončená produkce, hotové výrobky, vojenské zásoby
a obchodní zboží. Součástí zásob jsou i strategické rezervy státu, stavby vykazované u producentů a zásoby dřeva na pni
lesních porostů.
[/X][P][X]
Národní účty (National accounts) zahrnují cennosti (AN.13), které obsahují například drahé kameny a vzácné kovy, starožitnosti a ostatní umělecké nebo sběratelské předměty, které jejich majitelé nabývají a drží za účelem uchování hodnot.

Nevyráběná nefinanční aktiva (AN.2) představují hmotná nevyráběná aktiva, tj. přírodní zdroje (AN.21) – půdu, nerostné a energetické rezervy, nepěstované biologické zdroje a vodní zdroje, a ostatní přírodní zdroje (např. vysílací a komunikační frekvence), a smlouvy, pronájmy a licence (AN.22), např. obchodovatelný provozní pronájem, nakoupenou dobrou pověst (goodwill) nebo emisní povolenky.

Finanční aktiva a závazky (F, AF) obsahují zásobu hodnoty představující prospěch pro ekonomického vlastníka vyplývající z držby platebních prostředků, dluhových cenných papírů, poskytnutých půjček, účastí, finančních derivátů a ostatních pohledávek. Finanční aktiva mají odpovídající protipoložku v závazcích, které představují povinnost dlužníka provést platbu/platby věřiteli.

Měnové zlato a zvláštní práva čerpání (F.1, AF.1) jsou finančními (rezervními) aktivy České národní banky (F.11, AF.11) a jsou součástí devizových rezerv České republiky. Zvláštní práva čerpání (ZPČ) jsou mezinárodní rezervy aktiv u Mezinárodního měnového fondu (F.12, AF.12). Pro jejich držitele představují výlučná a bezpodmínečná práva získat jiná rezervní aktiva; vytvářejí rámec disponibilních úvěrů.

Oběživo a vklady (F.2, AF.2) v národní a cizí měně zahrnují oběživo (bankovky a mince, používané v platebním styku – F.21, AF.21), převoditelné vklady (vklady na běžných a žirových účtech, na vkladních knížkách bez výpovědní lhůty, netermínované vklady – F.22, AF.22 včetně mezibankovních vkladů) a ostatní vklady (F.29, AF.29) – termínované, či jinak omezené vklady, včetně úsporných vkladů a nepřevoditelných dluhových cenných papírů, depozitních certifikátů a vkladových listů.

Dluhové cenné papíry (F.3, AF.3) jsou převoditelné cenné papíry prokazující dluh emitenta a pohledávku věřitele. Sledují se v rozdělení podle doby původní splatnosti, tj. krátkodobé (se splatností do jednoho roku – F.31, AF.31) a dlouhodobé (se splatností delší než jeden rok – F.32, AF.32). Jsou to směnky, pokladniční poukázky, obligace s pevnou nebo pohyblivou úrokovou sazbou, v národní nebo cizí měně.

Půjčky (F.4, AF.4) jsou převedené finanční prostředky věřitelem dlužníkovi. Zahrnují zejména bankovní úvěry (investiční, spotřebitelské, hypotekární aj.), dále finanční půjčky (včetně půjček vyplývajících z finančního leasingu a splátkového prodeje) a jiné návratné finanční výpomoci mezi institucionálními jednotkami, včetně vztahů k Mezinárodnímu měnovému fondu nebo zemím Evropské unie. Sledují se v rozdělení na krátkodobé (F.41, AF.41) – s původní splatností do jednoho roku, a na požádání a dlouhodobé (F.42, AF.42) – s původní splatností delší než jeden rok.

Účasti (F.5, AF.5) představují podíl na majetku korporací nebo kvazikorporací a vyjadřují nárok na důchod z vlastnictví. Je to hodnota, kterou institucionální jednotky vykazují ve svých aktivech jako majetkové účasti (akcie, podíly, podílové listy) v listinné i zaknihované podobě. V rozvaze nefinančních a finančních korporací a kvazikorporací jsou vedeny na straně pasiv především jako základní kapitál. Položka F.5, AF.5 se sleduje v rozdělení na akcie a ostatní účasti (F51, AF51 – kótované akcie, nekótované akcie a ostatní účasti) a účasti v investičních fondech (F.52, AF.52 – akcie nebo podílové listy, včetně fondů peněžního trhu). Položka ostatní účasti obsahuje účasti ve společnostech s ručením omezeným, v družstvech, ve státních podnicích a v mezinárodních bankách.

Pojistné, penzijní a záruční programy (F.6, AF.6) vyjadřují závazky jednotek spravujících prostředky z uvedených programů a nároky oprávněných osob (na náhradu škody, výplatu budoucích penzí nebo uplatnění záruky). Jsou rozděleny do šesti skupin – technické rezervy neživotního pojištění (F.61, AF.61), životního pojištění (F.62, AF.62), penzijní nároky (F.63, AF.63), nároky penzijních fondů na penzijní správce (F.64, AF.64), nároky na jiné dávky než penzijní (F.65, AF.65; představují přebytek příspěvků nad dávkami a rovnají se úpravě na účtu užití důchodů) a rezervy na uplatnění záruky (F.66, AF.66).

Finanční deriváty zaměstnanecké opce na akcie (F.7, AF.7) jsou finanční nástroje (sekundární aktiva) ve formě smluvního uspořádání vázané na určitý finanční nástroj (např. dluhové cenné papíry), ukazatel nebo komoditu (např. nefinanční aktivum), které umožňují převádět finanční riziko na jiný subjekt. Položka F.7, AF.7 se člení na finanční deriváty (F.71, AF.71), tj. opce, forwardy, swapy, dohody o budoucích úrokových sazbách (FRA) a zaměstnanecké opce na akcie (F.72, AF.72).

Ostatní pohledávky/závazky (F.8, AF.8) vyplývají z časového nesouladu mezi transakcí a odpovídající platbou. Zahrnují obchodní úvěr (tj. pohledávky/závazky z dodavatelsko-odběratelských vztahů s výjimkou bankovního úvěru a půjček na financování obchodního úvěru) a zálohy na výrobky a služby (F.81, AF.81) a jiné pohledávky/závazky (F.89, AF.89), které nebyly zohledněny v jiných položkách finančního účtu a vztahují se např. k daním, sociálním příspěvkům, úrokům, mzdám atd.

Spotřeba fixního kapitálu (P.51c) představuje snížení hodnoty fixních aktiv vlivem fyzického a morálního opotřebení. Za všechny typy fixních aktiv je v celé časové řadě počítána metodou nepřetržité inventarizace (PIM).

Čisté pořízení nevyráběných aktiv (NP) obsahuje pořízení a úbytky hmotných a nehmotných nevyráběných aktiv, tj. přírodních zdrojů (NP.1), smluv, pronájmů a licencí (NP.2) a nákupu a prodeje goodwillu a marketingových aktiv (NP.3). Náklady na převody vlastnictví nevyráběných aktiv (AN.116) jsou však součástí tvorby hrubého fixního kapitálu. Přírůstky a úbytky hmotných nevyráběných aktiv se za národní hospodářství jako celek vyrovnají, neboť všichni vlastníci těchto aktiv jsou považováni za rezidenty.

V národních účtech jsou také zachyceny ostatní ekonomické toky ovlivňující změnu aktiv a závazků, které nejsou zachyceny ve formě transakcí na kapitálovém a finančním účtu. Jsou to ostatní změny objemu aktiv a závazků, nominální zisky a ztráty z držby (K.7).

Ostatní změny objemu aktiv a závazků (K.1 až K.6) zachycují dopad mimořádných a nepředvídaných událostí na objem aktiv a závazků. V národních účtech se sleduje ekonomický vznik aktiv (K.1), jako např. objevy využitelných přírodních zdrojů nebo zavedení emisních povolenek, ekonomický zánik nevyráběných aktiv (K.2), jako např. vyčerpání přírodních zdrojů, ztráty.
[/X][P][X]
Národní účty (National accounts) z katastrof (K.3), konfiskace bez náhrady (K.4), ostatní změny objemu jinde neuvedené (K.5), např. převody půdy, ztráty z titulu požáru, krádeží nebo napadení zásob hmyzem a změny v klasifikaci (K.6), tj. v sektorovém zatřídění institucionálních jednotek a v zatřídění aktiv a závazků.

Nominální zisky nebo ztráty z držby (K.7) vyjadřují změnu hodnoty aktiva (závazku i čistého jmění) v důsledku změn v úrovni a struktuře cen. Z analytického hlediska je velmi důležité, že systém rozděluje nominální zisky nebo ztráty z držby na neutrální (K.71) a reálné (K.72). Neutrální zisky z držby vyjadřují změnu všeobecné hladiny cen (pro všechna aktiva a závazky jsou počítány stejným cenovým indexem pro konečné národní užití s vyloučením změny zásob). Reálné zisky z držby jsou spočteny jako rozdíl mezi nominálními a neutrálními zisky z držby a vyjadřují hodnotu, jakou vlastník daného aktiva či závazku získal či ztratil za sledované období v poměru k průměrnému pohybu cen ostatních aktiv.

Hrubý domácí produkt (B.1*g) nebo čistý domácí produkt (B.1*n) – hrubý domácí produkt v tržních cenách – jako konečný výsledek výrobní činnosti všech rezidentských výrobců v ekonomice; Je počítán na základě výrobní, výdajové a důchodové metody. Výrobní metoda je založena na souhrnu přidané hodnoty a čistých daní z produktů. Výdajová metoda spočívá v součtu výdajů na konečnou spotřebu, tvorbu hrubého kapitálu a čistého vývozu. Důchodová metoda je založena na součtu náhrad zaměstnancům, hrubého provozního přebytku a smíšeného důchodu a čistých daní z výroby a dovozu. Čistý domácí produkt je rozdílem mezi položkou hrubého domácího produktu a spotřebou fixního kapitálu v ekonomice.

Hrubá přidaná hodnota (B.1g) nebo čistá přidaná hodnota (B.1n) – je souhrnný výsledek výrobní činnosti rezidentských výrobců určitého institucionálního sektoru/subsektoru, je vyrovnávací (bilanční) položkou účtu výroby a služeb daného sektoru/subsektoru. Čistá přidaná hodnota je rozdílovou položkou mezi hrubou přidanou hodnotou a spotřebou fixního kapitálu sektoru/subsektoru.

Provozní přebytek – hrubý (B.2g) nebo čistý (B.2n) – představuje zejména zisky podnikatelských subjektů (korigované např. o zisk z držby zásob), úroky a jiné důchody z vlastnictví kapitálu. Je stanoven jako rozdílová položka mezi hrubou přidanou hodnotou, náhradami zaměstnancům a čistými daněmi z výroby a z dovozu. Provozní přebytek v sektoru domácností obsahuje také činnosti bydlení ve vlastním obydlí.

Smíšený důchod – hrubý (B.3g) nebo čistý (B.3n) – je souhrnem důchodu z podnikání (zisku) a důchodu z pracovní činnosti osob samostatně výdělečně činných a zatříděných v sektoru domácností.

Podnikatelský důchod – hrubý (B.4g) nebo čistý (B.4n) – je vyrovnávací (bilanční) položkou účtu podnikatelských důchodů, odpovídající pojmu běžného zisku před rozdělením a zdaněním daní z příjmů, jak se běžně používá v podnikovém účetnictví.

Saldo prvotních důchodů, hrubých (B.5g) nebo čistých (B.5n) je bilanční položkou účtu rozdělení prvotních důchodů tj. důchodů z využívání výrobních činitelů (práce, půdy a kapitálu, včetně čistých daní z výroby a dovozu) určitého rezidentského sektoru/subsektoru.

Národní důchod – hrubý (B.5*g) nebo čistý (B.5*n) – je bilanční položkou účtu rozdělení prvotních důchodů, tj. důchodů z využívání výrobních činitelů (práce, půdy a kapitálu, včetně čistých daní z výroby a dovozu) národního hospodářství; je součtem sald prvotních důchodů za rezidentské sektory.

Disponibilní důchod – hrubý (B.6g) nebo čistý (B.6n) – je výsledkem tvorby a rozdělení důchodů, a proto bilanční položkou účtu druhotného rozdělení důchodů. Je to částka, kterou ekonomické subjekty určitého sektoru/subsektoru mohou věnovat na konečnou spotřebu a na úspory, tj. na akumulaci v hmotných, nehmotných nebo finančních aktivech. Národní disponibilní důchod – hrubý (B.6*g) nebo čistý (B.6*n) je celková částka za národní hospodářství, kterou je možné věnovat na konečnou spotřebu a na úspory.

Upravený disponibilní důchod – hrubý (B.7g) nebo čistý (B.7n) – je vyrovnávací položkou účtu znovurozdělení naturálních důchodů. Je tvořen disponibilními důchody sektorů upravenými o naturální sociální transfery mezi sektory. V úhrnu za národní hospodářství, tj. národní upravený disponibilní důchod hrubý (B.7*g) nebo čistý (B.7*n) je totožný s národním disponibilním důchodem (B.6).

Úspory – hrubé (B.8g) nebo čisté (B.8n) – jsou vyrovnávací položkou účtu užití důchodů. Představují částku, která je (při kladných úsporách) k dispozici na pořízení hmotných, nehmotných nebo finančních aktiv nebo na snížení finančních závazků, anebo (při záporných úsporách) musí být zajištěna snížením těchto aktiv nebo zvýšením závazků. Celkové zdroje akumulace za jednotlivé sektory jsou však vyšší nebo nižší o vliv kapitálových transferů. V sektorech vládních institucí, NISD a domácností jsou úspory rozdílem mezi disponibilními důchody a konečnou spotřebou. V ostatních sektorech se rovnají disponibilnímu důchodu. Národní úspory – hrubé (B.8*g) nebo čisté (B.8*n) jsou součtem úspor rezidentských institucionálních sektorů.

Čisté půjčky (+) nebo čisté výpůjčky (-) (B.9) vyjadřují částku, kterou je daný sektor schopen půjčit nebo nucen si vypůjčit od jiného sektoru. Za národní hospodářství jako celek vyjadřují zdroje, které národní ekonomika dala k dispozici nerezidentům nebo které si od nich vypůjčila. V sektoru vládních institucí se vládní přebytek nebo deficit (B.9) posuzuje ve vztahu k HDP ve smyslu maastrichtských kritérií (3 %). Položka B.9 je bilanční položkou kapitálového účtu a měla by odpovídat stejné položce ve finančním účtu, kde vyjadřuje celkovou změnu finančních aktiv a pasiv. Mezi oběma přístupy k výpočtu vyrovnávací položky zpravidla existuje statistická diskrepance. Odráží používání rozdílných informačních zdrojů, nepřesnosti, chyby a omyly při sestavování a zpracování údajů účetních nebo statistických výkazů, působí zde i vliv nedůsledného dodržování metodického pojetí jednotlivých položek. Finální statistická diskrepance je v procesu bilancování jednotlivých nefinančních i finančních transakcí minimalizována a nakonec obvykle umístěna do ostatních závazků a pohledávek (F.8). Čisté půjčky (+)/čisté výpůjčky (-) (B.9) sektoru vládních institucí (S.13) vyjadřují deficit/přebytek hospodaření vládních institucí, který předkládá každá členská země Evropské unie k posouzení a ke schválení Evropské komisi.

Změny čistého jmění (B.10) vyjadřují změny hodnoty aktiv a závazků v průběhu účetního období a shrnují částky zachycené v jednotlivých účtech akumulace, tj. změny čistého jmění vlivem úspor a kapitálových transferů, změny čistého jmění vlivem ostatních změn objemu aktiv a změny čistého jmění vlivem nominálních zisků/ztrát z držby.

Saldo dovozu a vývozu zboží a služeb (B.11) – jestliže je kladné, existuje přebytek pro nerezidenty a deficit pro tuzemské národní hospodářství, a naopak v případě, že je záporné.

Saldo běžných transakcí nerezidentů s rezidenty (B.12) – kladné nebo záporné, je výsledkem transakcí mezi rezidentskými a nerezidentskými institucionálními jednotkami v prvotním a druhotném rozdělení důchodů.

Čisté jmění (B.90) za národní hospodářství celkem se používá též pojem národní bohatství. Čisté jmění národního hospodářství celkem je součtem čistého jmění institucionálních sektorů. Představuje hodnotu nefinančních aktiv celého národního hospodářství plus saldo finančních aktiv a závazků vůči nerezidentům.

Ocenění
Toky a stavy jsou oceněny v tržních cenách. Pokud tržní cena není k dispozici (např. v případě netržních služeb poskytovaných vládními institucemi), ocenění je provedeno součtem nákladů na výrobu; jde o běžné ceny. Kromě toho toky a stavy jsou také vyjádřeny ve stálých cenách (tj. v cenách předchozího období).

Výrobci a uživatelé určitého produktu obvykle chápou jeho hodnotu odlišně, a to z důvodu dopravních nákladů, obchodních přirážek a daní z produktů snížených o dotace na produkty. Abychom se co nejblíže drželi hlediska jak výrobců, tak odběratelů, zachycuje se v systému veškeré užití v kupních cenách, které zahrnují dopravní náklady, obchodní přirážky a daně snížené o dotace na produkty, zatímco produkce je zachycena v základních cenách, které uvedené složky vylučují. Vývoz a dovoz komodit je sledován v cenách na hranici. Celkový vývoz a dovoz je oceněn v cenách na hranicích vývozce (FOB). Zahraniční doprava a služby pojištění mezi hranicemi vývozce a dovozce nejsou zahrnuty do ceny zboží, nýbrž se zaznamenávají jako služby.

Základní cena je cena, kterou má dostat výrobce od kupujícího za jednotku vyrobené produkce výrobků nebo služeb bez daně z produktů, splatné z této jednotky v důsledku její výroby nebo prodeje, ale včetně dotace na produkty získané na tuto jednotku v důsledku její výroby nebo prodeje. Jsou vyloučeny dopravní přirážky fakturované výrobcem samostatně a zisky a ztráty z držby nefinančních a finančních aktiv. Zahrnuty jsou dopravní přirážky účtované výrobcem na stejné faktuře, a to i když jsou na faktuře uvedeny jako samostatná položka.

Kupní cena je cena, kterou kupující skutečně platí za produkty k okamžiku nákupu. Je konstruována jako základní cena, která je zvýšena (+) a snížena (-) o tyto položky:
+ daně snížené o dotace na produkty (vyloučeny jsou však odpočitatelné daně na produkty jako DPH);
+ dopravní přirážky, které platí kupující, aby převzali dodávku v požadovaném čase a na požadovaném místě;
- množstevní nebo sezónní slevy z obvyklé ceny nebo sazby;
- úroky nebo poplatky za služby připočtené za poskytnutí úvěru;
- přirážky vznikající v důsledku nezaplacení v rámci lhůty stanovené v době, kdy byly nákupy uskutečněny.

Toto ocenění je určeno metodikou Evropského systému národních účtů, podrobně viz manuál k ESA 2010 kapitola 1 (body 1.94 až 1.100) a kapitola 3 (body 3.06 a 3.44).

Poznámky k tabulkám
Tab. 5-1 až 5-19 Ukazatele tvorby, rozdělení a užití důchodu, aktiv a závazků. Účet výrobků a služeb (tabulky 5-1 a 5-2) zobrazuje reálné toky výrobků a služeb v ekonomice. Zachycuje celkové zdroje (produkci a dovoz) výrobků a služeb a jejich užití v rozdělení na mezispotřebu, konečnou spotřebu, tvorbu hrubého kapitálu (fixního kapitálu, změnu stavu zásob, včetně cenností) a vývoz. Vzhledem k tomu, že produkce je oceněna v základních cenách a užití v cenách kupních, jsou zde uvedeny i daně z produktů a dotace na produkty. Účet výrobků a služeb je vyrovnaný (nemá žádnou vyrovnávací položku). Je součástí národních účtů za národní hospodářství jako celek.

FISIM (P.119), tj. služby finančního zprostředkování nepřímo měřené, jsou součtem dvou implicitních poplatků placených vypůjčovatelem a půjčovatelem. Je kalkulován jako rozdíl mezi referenční sazbou a sazbou skutečně placenou vkladatelům a účtovanou vypůjčovatelům. Vztahuje se pouze na půjčky a vklady finančních institucí (S.122 a S.125; s výjimkou mezibankovních půjček a vkladů) a zahrnuje se do jejich produkce. Stejná částka je alokována do mezispotřeby ostatních institucionálních sektorů/subsektorů, do konečné spotřeby nebo zahrnuta do vývozu.

Tab. 5-3 až 5-17 obsahují přehled hlavních makroekonomických ukazatelů národního hospodářství celkem a v rozdělení podle odvětví a institucionálních sektorů. Charakterizují nefinanční transakce (transakce s výrobky a službami, rozdělovací a kapitálové transakce), finanční transakce a rozvahové položky (stavy). Dále zobrazují vztahy k nerezidentům, čisté jmění a jeho změny a stavy nefinančních a finančních aktiv a stavy závazků.

Tab. 5-18 a 5-19 Deficit vládních institucí a Dluh vládních institucí obsahují v časové řadě přehled ukazatelů ovlivňujících deficit a dluh sektoru vládních institucí (viz institucionální sektory) v rozdělení podle subsektorů. Vymezení vládního deficitu a dluhu je v souladu s mezinárodními standardy a nařízeními orgánů EU.

Deficit rozpočtů vládních institucí představuje výši čistých výpůjček (-B.9) vládních institucí; přebytek rozpočtů vládních institucí představuje výši čistých půjček (+B.9) vládních institucí. Hodnota B.9 čisté půjčky (+) / čisté výpůjčky (-) je základem pro hodnocení rozpočtového hospodaření vládních institucí podle maastrichtských kritérií (3 % z HDP). Pro tento účel (Excessive deficit procedure) se již B.9 o úroky ze swapových operací a operací s termínovými úrokovými dohodami (FRA) na tzv. EDP B.9 neupravuje. Položky D.4, D.7 a D.9 jsou konsolidované, tj. jsou vyloučeny transfery uvnitř každého subsektoru vládních institucí.

Propočet dluhu vládních institucí je založen na metodice ESA 2010 a Manuálu k vládnímu deficitu a dluhu a posuzuje se ve vztahu k HDP ve smyslu maastrichtských kritérií (60 % z HDP). Dluh vládních institucí (vyjádřený v nominální hodnotě) představuje souhrn závazků vyplývajících z přijatých vkladů, vydaných dluhových cenných papírů a přijatých úvěrů, půjček a návratných finančních výpomocí (AF.2+AF.3+AF.4). Přijaté vklady (jako součást dluhu vládních institucí) byly vykázány pouze v letech 2001 až 2006 z titulu zatřídění České konsolidační agentury v S.13. V současné době jsou přijaté vklady opět součástí dluhu vládních institucí z titulu zatřídění České exportní banky, Národní rozvojové banky (dříve pod názvem Českomoravská záruční a rozvojová banka) a Garančního systému finančního trhu (dříve Fondu pojištění vkladů) do S.1311 (v souladu s metodikou ESA 2010).

Tab. 5-20 Podrobné členění daní a sociálních příspěvků sektoru vládních institucí obsahuje přehled běžných (D.2.a D.5) a kapitálových daní (D.91) a čistých sociálních příspěvků (D.61) na sociální a zdravotní pojištění, které jsou zdrojem příjmů sektoru (subsektorů) vládních institucí. Uvedené údaje jsou v souladu s údaji národních účtů za S.13 a pravidly ESA 2010. Jejich propočet je založen na tzv. metodě časového posunu, která umožňuje eliminovat vliv daní (daňových „příjmů“), které pravděpodobně nebudou nikdy vybrány. Vzhledem k tomu nejsou položky pod kódem D.995 obsazeny.

Tab. 5-21 až 5-27 Ukazatele nefinančních aktiv poskytují pohled na odvětvovou strukturu (v souladu s mezinárodním standardem NACE) nefinančních aktiv, na jejich celkový objem, tvorbu hrubého fixního kapitálu, pořízení vybraných druhů fixních aktiv a na změny v zásobách. Stavy fixních aktiv jsou vyjádřeny v čistých (zůstatkových) reprodukčních cenách, tj. v kupních cenách snížených o kumulovanou spotřebu fixního kapitálu.

National accounts
Methodological notes
National accounts compiled in the Czech Republic are based on the ESA 2010 European standard (the Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the European Union) and many additional and specifying regulations. The skeleton of the Czech national accounts consists of a set of sector/subsector accounts (compiled with quarterly and annual periodicity), followed by other tables and balances, especially supply and use tables and balances of non-financial assets and a detailed overview of tax receipts and social contribution receipts.

Sector accounts capture all material, income, financial, and other flows among all economic entities in the national economy as well as vis-à-vis the rest of the world (the ROW, non-residents) and at the same time results of these flows. To capture such a complex economic mechanism (as the national economy is) in its complexity and in a rather simple form, all economic entities in the national economy are grouped to several groups (the so-called institutional sectors/subsectors). The classification is carried out according to their prevailing role in the economy and all the various flow and stock quantities are arranged to a system of accounts and tables.

Institutional sectors
National accounts describe the economic process broken down by institutional sector and subsector. Each sector/subsector comprises units similar in basic activities, functions, and economic behaviour and belonging to the same type of producer. Each unit is only classified to one sector/subsector (regardless of its legal form). The total economy (S.1) consists of resident institutional sectors as follows:
– non-financial corporations (S.11) principal activity of which is production and providing of goods and non-financial services; they include e.g. agricultural, industrial, construction and transport corporations, schools and health establishments (joint-stock companies, cooperatives, state-owned corporations, etc.);
– financial corporations (S.12), which are primarily engaged in financial intermediation or auxiliary financial activities; they include e.g. banks, credit cooperatives, money market funds, investment funds, financial leasing companies, captive companies (e.g. holding financial companies), auxiliary financial institutions (stock exchanges or investment companies), insurance companies, and pension funds;
– general government (S.13), output of which is designed for individual and collective consumption and that are financed particularly by obligatory payments from units classified to other sectors. They are organisational units of the state (e.g. ministries, central authorities and organisations managed by the authorities), extra-budgetary funds and other central institutions; territorial self-governing units (Regions, municipalities, towns, and voluntary unions of municipalities), semi-budgetary organisations and social security funds (health insurance companies managing general health insurance). There are also non-profit institutions and non-financial and financial corporations, which are dealt with as non-market units, classified in S.13 in accordance with the qualitative and quantitative criteria of the ESA 2010;
– households (S.14), which include individuals or groups of individuals as final consumers and small entrepreneurs producing market goods and services (craftsmen, self-employed own-account farmers, physicians, barristers, solicitors, tax advisers, etc.), and dwelling unit owners associations;
– non-profit institutions serving households (S.15), which are non-market producers; they include political parties, churches or religious societies, foundations, trade unions, professional or learned societies, interest organisations and charities, etc.

National accounts also describe economic transactions with the rest of the world (also referred to as non-residents), i.e. with units seated outside the economic territory of the Czech Republic for at least one year. The rest of the world (S.2) is a grouping of units (whatever their function and resources are), which is divided to Member States and institutions of the European Union (EU) and states outside the EU. They include e.g. embassies of foreign countries or international organisations, which were founded and operate under international agreements, or detached parts of parent companies (e.g. branches of manufacturing enterprises, banks, and insurance companies). Data for the rest of the world are not included in items of the total economy (S.1).

In Czech national accounts, in each institutional sector, all production units are grouped to economic activities also according to the character of their prevailing activity. For classification of each production unit to an economic activity, the Classification of Economic Activities (CZ-NACE) is used, which corresponds to the European standard of the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community, Rev. 2 (NACE Rev. 2).

Sequence of accounts
Another characteristic of the national accounts is that all flow and stock quantities are grouped according to their economic character and they are arranged to a system of accounts and tables. General principles of the arrangement and records in the national accounts are similar to general principles known from the business accounting. Each of the accounts in the system is balanced. It results either from the definition of the accounts (goods and services account) or a balancing item is used, which is then transferred to the next account. Balancing items are recorded in the accounts either as net or gross. The difference in both concepts lies in consumption of fixed capital. The goods and services account is only...

National accounts
compiled for the total national economy, while all other accounts are compiled for each institutional sector and subsector, and,
naturally, also for the total national economy.
The goods and services account shows how total sources (production, imports, and net taxes on products) for the total
national economy are used (for intermediate consumption, final consumption, capital formation, and for exports). In accordance
with the general definition, the total volume of sources is balanced with their uses. Since this account captures flows of goods
and services, which have the opposite direction in an economy than flows of money paid for them, the sources and uses are
shown on the opposite sides than it is in sector accounts.
Current accounts capture generation, distribution, and redistribution of income and its uses for final consumption. Saving
(B.8) is the resulting balancing item; it is a newly created source for accumulation. Current accounts are: production account,
generation of income account, primary distribution of income account (it is further broken down into entrepreneurial income
account and distribution of other primary income account), secondary distribution of income account, redistribution of income
in kind account, and use of income account. The use of income account has the form of two accounts that are different in their
contents – the use of disposable income account and the use of adjusted disposable income account.
Accumulation accounts show for each sector changes in volume and valuation of respective components of its assets and
liabilities. The entire set of accumulation accounts consists of the following accounts: the capital account, the financial account,
and other changes of assets accounts. The capital account is broken down into the change in net worth due to saving and
capital transfers account and the acquisition of non-financial assets account; other changes of assets accounts are broken
down into the other changes in volume of assets account and the revaluation accounts – nominal, neutral, and real holding
gains/losses accounts.
Balance sheet accounts capture values of assets and liabilities, which are at a certain moment (at the beginning and the end
of a calendar year or quarter) in holding of a given sector or subsector and changes in the balance sheet. Net worth (B.90) is
the balancing item; in the total for the national economy it expresses the national wealth, i.e. all non-financial and financial
assets after deduction of financial liabilities vis-à-vis the rest of the world (non-residents). The importance of a balance sheet
for the entire national accounts system is that it makes the sequence of accounts complete, because it shows the final result
of records in current and accumulation accounts. Balance sheet accounts are: the opening balance sheet, changes in balance,
and the closing balance sheet.
Accounts of the rest of the world (non-residents) are used to capture transactions between resident units and the rest of
the world (non-resident units); thus that, what is a resource for the non-residents is a use for the residents. The sequence of
accounts is similar as for accounts of resident institutional sectors, i.e. the goods and services account of the ROW, the primary
income account and the current transfers account of the ROW. Further they are: accumulation accounts of the ROW (split into
a capital account and a financial account of the ROW, the other changes of assets account of the ROW, i.e. the other changes
in volume of assets account of the ROW and the revaluation account) and balances of the ROW.
Accounts of the ROW (non-residents) capture flows and stocks between non-residents and residents; they do not capture
relationships among non-residents, i.e. they do not show the total for the rest of the entire world. Therefore, the same detailed
breakdown of individual flows and stocks in the accounts of the ROW is used in the Czech practice as at resident sectors
including detailed breakdown of accumulation accounts and balance sheet accounts.
Characteristics of indicators
Each indicator in the system of national accounts (transactions, other flows, and stocks) is designated by a code, which is
consistent with the ESA 2010 international standard or results from it. Transactions in goods and services are designated by P
codes (and in non-produced assets by NP codes), distributive transactions by D, balancing items by Bg (gross approach incl.
consumption of fixed capital) or Bn (net approach excl. consumption of fixed capital). Transactions in financial assets and
liabilities are indicated by F and other changes in assets, liabilities, and net worth by K. Stocks of non-financial assets presented
in opening and closing balance sheets are designated by AN codes and stocks of financial assets including other accounts
receivable/payable by AF codes. A more detailed breakdown of the standard national accounts items is supplemented by an
X code, e.g. XAF. Alphabetic codes are supplemented by numerical codes, e.g. B.1g or AF.89.
The ESA 2010 also covers functional classifications: the COFOG (Classification of the Functions of Government), the COPNI
(Classification of the Purposes of Non-Profit Institutions Serving Households), the COICOP (Classification of Individual
Consumption by Purpose), the NACE Rev. 2 for economic activities, and the CPA 2015 (Classification of Products by Activity)
for products by economic activity.
Output (P.1) is the value of market and non-market goods and services produced by resident units in the territory of the Czech
Republic in a given period. It is composed of:
– market output (P.11), which includes, above all, sales of goods and services of own production, trade margin, and changes
in inventories of work in progress and goods;
– output for own final use (P.12) – i.e. non-market output that is retained by a unit either for its capital formation or for its own
final consumption. It especially includes the capitalization of goods and services, agricultural output of households for own
consumption, individual housing construction of households, and imputed rental of households living in owner-occupied
dwellings;
– non-market output (P.13), which is the sum of non-market output provided at economically insignificant prices (P.131
payments for non-market output) and non-market output provided for free (P.132 non-market output, other). The latter is
[/X][P][X]

National accounts
expressed as the difference between operating expenses, inclusive of net taxes on production and imports, spent by
the general government and non-profit institutions serving households (NPISHs) on the one hand and their sales of goods
and services (P.11 + P.131) and output for own final use (P.12) on the other hand.
Intermediate consumption (P.2) is the value of the goods and services (including financial intermediation services indirectly
measured – FISIM) used up by resident producers in the process of producing other goods (products) and services during
the relevant period.
Final consumption expenditure (P.3) includes expenditure on final consumption of households, the general government, and
non-profit institutions serving households. Final consumption is the value of goods (products) and services designed to satisfy
collective and individual needs. It is broken down from the point of view of the payment (who is usually the payer) and from
the point of view of the consumer. Final consumption expenditure is further split into:
– individual consumption expenditure (P.31), which is the sum of individual consumption expenditure of households,
the general government, and NPISHs. Household expenditure on individual consumption especially include purchases of
goods and market services (including FISIM), dwelling services (imputed rental for households living in owner-occupied
dwellings), the value of products produced by households for their own consumption, e.g. fruit and vegetables; products and
services provided for free or at a discount and purchases of Czech tourists abroad. Expenditure covered by the general
government is determined according to the corresponding government functions (COFOG). Final consumption expenditure
of non-profit institutions serving households are set at the level of the free non-market services of these institutions, and
the whole of it is considered to be individual final consumption expenditure;
– collective consumption expenditure (P.32) of the general government is set in the scope of its expenditure on collective
consumption according to the corresponding functions (COFOG).
Actual final consumption (P.4) is the sum of actual (final) individual consumption of households (P.41 or the sum of
expenditure of households, the general government, and non-profit institutions serving households on individual consumption)
and actual (final) collective consumption of the general government (P.42, which is the expenditure of the general
government on collective consumption). The actual final consumption (P.4) is thus equal to the sum of all final consumption expenditure
(P.3) at the level of the national economy.
Gross fixed capital formation (P.51g) includes acquisitions less disposals of fixed assets (P.511) plus certain additions to
the value of non-produced assets, costs of ownership transfer on non-produced assets (P.512), and acquisitions less disposals
of non-produced assets (NP). The acquisitions of fixed assets include new or existing fixed assets purchased (including own
account production of the assets) technical improvements (reconstruction, modernization, reclamation of land and the like),
and free acquisitions of existing fixed assets. The disposals of fixed assets include sales and free transfers of existing fixed
assets. Gross fixed capital formation also comprises acquisitions less disposals of military equipment (which were previously,
in compliance with the ESA95 methodology, included in the intermediate consumption and final consumption of the general
government). The P.51g item is showed in the breakdown by fixed asset (dwellings, buildings and structures, machinery and
equipment, weapon systems etc.).
Changes in inventories (P.52) are measured by the value of the entries into inventories less the value of withdrawals and the
value of any recurrent losses of goods held in inventories, adjusted for price changes and accidental damage.
Acquisitions less disposals of valuables (P.53) is acquisition of such goods that are not used primarily for production or
consumption, do not deteriorate (physically) over time under normal conditions and that are acquired and held primarily as
stores of value.
Exports (P.6) and imports (P.7) of goods and services refer to the value of goods and services traded among resident and
non-resident units. Imports include, for example, the consumption by Czech citizens abroad and, vice-versa, exports include
consumption by foreigners in the Czech Republic. The transactions are recorded split into transactions in goods and in services
(exports and imports) and also within EU Member States and outside the EU. Exports are recorded in the FOB prices (i.e. free
on board, prices on the border of the exporting country) and imports are recorded in the CIF prices (i.e. cost, insurance and
freight, prices on the border of the importing country) in the supply and use tables and for the purposes of the gross domestic
product (GDP) estimates. In sector accounts, both the exports and imports are recorded in the FOB prices. Data on exports
also cover the value of FISIM.
Compensation of employees (D.1) – both in money and kind includes wages and salaries and social contributions paid by
employers:
– wages and salaries (D.11) – total remuneration of employees (in cash or in kind) for work they had done. They include
wages and salaries for work done for the employer; salaries of members of cooperatives and associates; salaries and
expenditure on uniforms of professional members of the armed forces. They also include contributions to employees for
commuting to and from work, their meals, cultural and sports interests, and other; products and services provided to
employees free of charge or at a reduced price are also included. They are given before income tax, statutory (mandatory)
contributions to general social and health insurance schemes and other deductions, if any;
– employers’ social contributions (D.12) – paid by employers for their employees to general social and health insurance
schemes, supplementary pension and health insurance, compulsory accident insurance (employers’ actual social
contributions) and direct social assistance provided by employers (non-recoverable assistance paid. It is paid, for
example, from the social fund) and a wage compensation (sickness benefit) paid by an employer in the period of incapacity
for work of employees during the period stipulated by law (employers’ imputed social contributions). The D.12 item is further
split into pension insurance contributions and other social insurance contributions.

Taxes on production and imports (D.2): indirect taxes, which include taxes on products (e.g. value added tax (VAT), duties, taxes on imports, excise duties, etc.) and other taxes on production (e.g. real estate taxes, road tax, air and water pollution charges, etc.). Data on tax revenue adjusted by the time-shift method (deferral) are the basis for the calculation, i.e. the corresponding amount is shifted to the period, in which the tax liability incurred.

Subsidies (D.3) are unrequited payments, which the general government or institutions of the European Union make to producers. They are split into subsidies on products and other subsidies on production:
– subsidies on products (D.31) – provided per unit of produced goods and provided services; mostly compensation for losses in production and providing of services; they include, e.g., subsidies on agricultural products, passenger transport, or heat;
– other subsidies on production (D.39) cover subsidies to businesses and subsidies to enterprises, which employ persons with reduced capacity to work, especially subsidies to cover current losses, or subsidies on intentional reduction of mining and quarrying activities, or subsidies to production from EU funds.

Net property income (D.4) is the difference between receivable and payable income from the ownership of financial and tangible non-produced assets. It includes interest (on deposits, debt securities, loans including financial leasing, adjusted for the value of FISIM), dividends and profit share (excluding superdividends), some other income from distributed profit, and drawing of entrepreneurial income and rents on land. Interest on swap and forward rate agreement (FRA) operations is recorded on the financial account. Superdividends (e.g. retained and paid at once for several years) are recorded on the financial account, as withdrawal of shares by their owner.

Current taxes on income, wealth, etc. (D.5) are taxes on income and capital gains (direct taxes), including additional tax payments and tax penalties. They are taxes on income of natural and legal persons including taxes on interest, dividends, winnings from betting and lotteries, and real estate purchase and sale taxes. Data on tax revenue adjusted by the time-shift method (deferral) are the basis for the calculation. Further, they include some of administration charges (e.g. dog fees or entry fees, etc.). Since January 2014, taxes on income also include revenue from inheritance and gifts that cannot be identified. Property taxes on financial assets have not been introduced to the tax system of the Czech Republic.

Net social contributions (D.61) – compulsory and voluntary: are split by payer (paid by employers for their employees and by households, i.e. by employees, private payers (the self-employed, own-account workers)) and into actual and imputed social contributions. Actual social contributions show in total all payments to providers of social benefits, i.e. contributions to compulsory social, health, and compulsory accident insurance and supplementary pension insurance. Imputed social contributions are direct social support from employers (this second imputation results from the need to balance the relation to social benefits). Within the social contributions, pension and non-pension social contributions are reported, too. Social contributions also comprise payment for services provided by corporations that administer the contributions. Social contributions revenue of the general government is adjusted by the time-shift method.

Social benefits other than social transfers in kind (D.62): benefits resulting from participation in social insurance schemes, i.e. under the social security system (general social insurance scheme and compulsory accident insurance schemes paid by employers for their employees) and supplementary pension insurance schemes. They also include social benefits in cash paid by municipalities (from the budget, outside insurance schemes) in the framework of care for the family or care for senior citizens and wage compensation (sickness benefit) paid by an employer in the period of incapacity for work of their employees. Social benefits are presented as split into benefit from pension insurance, other social insurance benefits, and social assistance benefits.

Social transfers in kind (D.63): transfers from the general government or from non-profit institutions serving households to households. They refer to the value of goods and services provided, above all, in the form of health and social care, education, housing. They especially include benefits in kind related to health insurance (payments for health aids, medical and dental treatment, medical operations, and the like) paid by health insurance companies to providers of such goods and services. They also include benefits in kind provided by municipalities and the value of goods and services amounting to expenditure of the general government and non-profit institutions serving households on individual consumption. Social benefits in kind are divided according to whether the goods and services were produced as non-market output by the government units and NPISHs or purchased by the units on the market (including reimbursements of approved expenditure of households for some specific goods or services).

Other current transfers (D.7) include non-life insurance premiums and reinsurance premiums, non-life insurance claims, payments within the general government sector, current international cooperation, and other current transfers. Non-life insurance is recorded as net non-life insurance premiums (i.e. insurance premiums after deducting the service charges of insurance enterprises arranging the insurance) and insurance claims. They exclude transactions linked to life insurance, supplementary pension insurance or general social and health insurance. Current transfers within the general government sector comprise non-investment transfers between the state budget and local government budgets; transfers between units of the same subsector of the general government sector are consolidated (e.g. between the state budget and public universities). Current international cooperation includes transfers between the Government of the Czech Republic and governments of other countries or international organisations (e.g., payments within the European Union and the United Nations or subsidies from the EU funds, or gifts of food, technical assistance, and other assistance). The miscellaneous current transfers include current transfers to non-profit institutions serving households (membership subscriptions and financial support to political, trade union, church, and similar institutions, payments for humanitarian purposes), current transfers between households (financial assistance and gifts from relatives, child support (maintenance) or alimony, including private international transfers). Other transfers not included above (such as fines, penalties imposed in an administrative procedure, on-the-spot fines, winnings or bets up to the level of winnings, compensation payments – sanction and recourse claims, etc.). The last sub-item includes.

payments of government units to the EU institutions (so-called EU own resources derived from the VAT and the gross national income).
Adjustment for the change in pension entitlements (D.8) is the amount designed to adjust disposable income of households and pension funds to balance pension claims of households with changes in pension liabilities (“reserves”) of pension funds on the financial account. It is determined as the difference between insurance premiums received and pensions paid. Life insurance of (members of) households is understood as saving in the national accounts.
Capital transfers (D.9) are unrequited transactions, which result in a change of ownership of non-financial or financial assets. They include capital taxes (inheritance tax and gift tax), investment grants (e.g. from the funds of the EU), and other capital transfers, especially inheritance and gifts of investment nature, tangible and financial restitution compensation, free transfers of property, or transfers by virtue of called government guarantees and debt cancellation. Inheritance and gift taxes were cancelled (in the Czech Republic) at the end of 2013 and all revenue from inheritance or gifts have become part of income tax since January 2014.
Non-financial assets (AN) include produced (AN.1) and non-produced non-financial assets (AN.2). The produced non-financial assets are further split into fixed assets (AN.11), inventories (AN.12), and valuables (AN.13).
The fixed assets (AN.11) include non-financial (produced) assets used in a production process for a period longer than one year. They include e.g. dwellings, other buildings and structures, machinery and equipment, weapon systems, cultivated assets, costs of ownership transfer on non-produced assets and intellectual property products.
Inventories (AN.12) comprise materials and supplies intended for intermediate consumption, work in progress, finished goods, military inventories, and goods for resale. Inventories also include strategic reserves of the state, constructions reported by producers, and standing timber inventories.
Valuables (AN.13) include e.g. precious stones and metals, antiques, and works of art acquired and held by their owners for the purpose of preserving value.
Non-produced non-financial assets (AN.2) encompass tangible non-produced assets, i.e. natural resources (AN.21) – land, mineral and energy reserves, non-cultivated biological resources, water resources, and other natural resources (e.g. radio spectra) and contracts, leases and licences (AN.22) (e.g. marketable operating leases, purchased goodwill, or emission permits).
Financial assets and liabilities (F, AF) comprise stores of value representing benefit accruing to an economic owner by holding means of payment, debt securities, provided loans, shares, financial derivatives, and other receivables. Financial assets have a corresponding counterpart in liabilities, which represent debtor’s obligation to make the payment/payments to the creditor.
Monetary gold and Special Drawing Rights (F.1, AF.1): monetary gold is a financial (reserve) asset of the Czech National Bank (F.11, AF.11) and part of the foreign currency reserves of the Czech Republic. Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) are international reserves of assets with the International Monetary Fund (F.12, AF.12). Their holders have exclusive and unconditional rights to acquire other reserve assets; they create a framework for disposable loans.
Currency and deposits (F.2, AF.2) comprise the following in national and foreign currencies: currency (notes and coins in circulation that are commonly used to make payments – F.21, AF.21), transferable deposits (deposits on current and giro accounts, savings books without notice – F.22, AF.22, including inter-bank deposits), and other deposits. Other deposits (F.29, AF.29) include term deposits or deposits restricted in any other way, including saving deposits and non-negotiable debt securities, deposit certificates, and deposit sheets.
Debt securities (F.3, AF.3) comprise transferable securities showing the issuer´s debt and the receivable of the creditor. Transactions in debt securities are divided by original maturity, i.e. short-term debt securities (with maturity up to one year – F.31, AF.31) and long-term debt securities (maturity of which exceeds one year – F.32, AF.32). They are treasury bills and bonds with a fixed or floating interest rate, in national or foreign currency.
Loans (F.4, AF.4) are transferred funds by the creditor to the debtor. They comprise, above all, bank loans (of investment, consumer, mortgage, etc. types), financial loans (incl. financial leasing loans and hire purchase) and other recoverable financial assistance between institutional units, including relations to the International Monetary Fund or EU Member States. They are divided into short-term loans (F.41, AF.41) with original maturity up to one year plus loans repayable on demand and long-term loans (F.42, AF.42) with original maturity over one year.
Equity and investment fund shares or units (F.5, AF.5) are the share in assets of corporations and quasi-corporations and express the right to receive income from ownership. They refer to the value reported by institutional units in their assets as participating interest (shares, units) in materialised and dematerialised forms. In the balance sheet of non-financial and financial corporations and quasi-corporations they are reported predominantly as registered capital on the liability side. The F.5, AF.5 item is measured broken down into equity (F.51, AF.51 – in the form of listed shares, unlisted shares, and other equity) and investment fund shares or units (F.52, AF.52 – in the form of money market fund (MMF) shares or units and non-MMF investment fund shares/units). The ‘other equity’ item contains equity in limited liability companies, cooperatives, state enterprises, and in international banks.
Insurance, pension and standardised guarantee schemes (F.6, AF.6) reflect liabilities of units administrating funds from the schemes and claims of beneficiaries (for compensations for damage, payments of future pensions, or called guarantees). They are divided into six groups: non-life insurance technical reserves (F.61, AF.61), life insurance and annuity entitlements (F.62, AF.62), pension entitlements (F.63, AF.63). Other items record claims of pension funds on pension managers (F.64,

AF.64), entitlements to non-pension benefits (F.65, AF.65 – representing surplus of contributions over benefits and equal adjustment on the use of income account), and provisions for calls under standardised guarantees (F.66, AF.66).
Financial derivatives and employee stock options (F.7, AF.7) – are financial instruments (secondary assets) in the form of contractual agreement linked to a specified financial instrument (e.g. debt securities) or to an indicator or commodity (e.g. non-financial assets), which enable transferring specific financial risk to other entity. The F.7, AF.7 item includes financial derivatives (F.71, AF.71), .i.e. options, forwards, swaps, forward rate agreements (FRA), etc. and employee stock options (F.72, AF.72).
Other accounts receivable/payable (F.8, AF.8) result from time delay between a transaction and the corresponding payment. They include trade credits (i.e. receivables/payables from supplier-customer relations except for bank credits and loans to pay business credits), trade credits and advances (F.81, AF.81), and other accounts receivable/payable (F.89, AF.89), which were not accounted for in other items of the financial account and are related e.g. to taxes, social contributions, interest, wages, etc.
Consumption of fixed capital (P.51c) is the decline in value of fixed assets owned, as a result of normal wear and tear and obsolescence. For all types of fixed assets it is calculated by the perpetual inventory method (PIM) in the entire time series.
Acquisitions less disposals of non-produced assets (NP) include acquisitions less disposals of tangible and intangible non-produced assets, i.e. natural resources (NP.1), contracts, leases and licences (NP.2) and purchases less sales of goodwill and marketing assets (NP.3). Costs of ownership transfers of non-produced assets (AN.116) are, however, included in the gross fixed capital formation (P.51). Acquisitions less disposals of tangible non-produced assets are balanced for the total national economy because all owners of these assets are considered as residents.
National accounts also record other economy flows that effect changes in assets and liabilities, which are not recorded in the form of transactions on the capital and financial account. They are other changes in the volume of assets and liabilities (K.1 to K.6) and nominal holding gains and losses (K.7).
Other changes in the volume of assets and liabilities (K.1 to K.6) record the impact of extraordinary and unpredictable events on the volume of assets and liabilities. National accounts record the economic appearance of assets (K.1) such as economic appearance of exploitable natural resources or introduction of emission permits and, economic disappearance of non-produced assets (K.2) such as depletion of natural resources. Further they are catastrophic losses (K.3), uncompensated seizures (K.4), other changes in volume n.e.c. (K.5, e.g. transfers of land, losses due to fire, theft or losses on insect-infected inventories), and changes in classification (K.6), i.e. in sector classification of institutional units and changes in classification of assets and liabilities.
Nominal holding gains/losses (K.7) show a change in the value of assets (of both liabilities and net worth) resulting from changes in the level and structure of prices. From an analytical point of view, it is very important that the system splits nominal holding gains/losses (K.7) into neutral holding gains/losses (K.71) and real holding gains/losses (K.72). Neutral holding gains/losses express a change in the general price level (for all assets and liabilities they are calculated by the same price index for final national use excluding change in inventories). Real holding gains/losses are calculated as the nominal minus neutral holding gains/losses and express the value, which was gained or lost by the owner of a given asset or liability during the reference period in relation to the average price movement of other assets.
Gross domestic product (B.1*g) or net domestic product (B.1*n) – gross domestic product at market prices – as the final result of the production activity of all resident producers in the economy, is calculated on the basis of a production, expenditure, and income method. The production method is based on the sum of the value added and net taxes on products.
The expenditure method is the sum of expenditure on final consumption, gross capital formation, and net exports. The income method is based on the sum of compensation of employees, gross operating surplus, and mixed income, and net taxes on production and imports. Net domestic product is the difference between gross domestic product and fixed capital consumption in the economy.
Gross value added (B.1g) or net value added (B.1n) – is the total result of production activity of resident producers of a certain institutional sector/subsector, balancing item of the goods and services account of the sector/subsector. Net value added is the difference item between gross value added and fixed capital consumption in the sector/subsector.
Operating surplus – gross (B.2g) or net (B.2n) includes mainly profits of enterprises (adjusted e.g. by holding gains), interest and other income from ownership of capital. It is determined as the balancing item between the gross value added, compensation of employees and net taxes on production and imports. The operating surplus in the sector of households also includes activities of living in owner-occupied dwellings.
Mixed income – gross (B.3g) or net (B.3n) is the sum of income from business (profits) and income from work activities of the self-employed classified in the households sector.
Entrepreneurial income – gross (B.4g) or net (B.4n) is a balancing item of the entrepreneurial income account; it corresponds to the concept of current profit before distribution and income tax as normally used in business accounting.
Balance of primary incomes – gross (B.5g) or net (B.5n) is a balancing item of the distribution of primary income account, i.e. income resulting from the use of production factors (labour, land, and capital including net taxes on production and imports) of the resident sector/subsector.
National income – gross (B.5*g) or net (B.5*n) is a balancing item of the distribution of primary income account, i.e. income resulting from the use of production factors (labour, land, and capital including net taxes on production and imports) of the national economy; it is the sum of primary income balances for resident sectors.

Disposable income – gross (B.6g) or net (B.6n) results from the generation and distribution of income of the sector/subsector and thus it is the balancing item of the secondary distribution of income account. It is an amount, which businesses can give to final consumption and saving, i.e. to accumulation in tangible, intangible or financial assets. National disposable income – gross (B.6*b) or net (B.6*n) is the total amount for the national economy that can be devoted to final consumption and saving.

Adjusted disposable income – gross (B.7g) or net (B.7n) is a balancing item of the redistribution of income in kind account. It consists of disposable income of sectors adjusted for social transfers in kind between sectors. For the total national economy, i.e. national adjusted disposable income – gross (B.7*g) or net (B.7*n) it is equal to the disposable income (B.6).

Saving – gross (B.8g) or net (B.8n) is a balancing item of the use of income account. It is an amount, which is (if the saving is positive) available for acquisition of tangible, intangible, and financial assets or for lowering of financial liabilities or which (if the saving is negative) has to be provided for by lowering these assets or by an increase of the liability. Nevertheless, total resources of accumulation for respective sectors are either higher or lower by the effect of capital transfers. In the general government, NPISHs, and households sectors, saving is the difference between disposable income and final consumption. It equals disposable income in other sectors. National saving – gross (B.8*g) or (B.8*n) is the sum of saving of resident institutional sectors.

The net lending (+) or borrowing (-) (B.9) is an amount that a given sector can lend to or has to borrow from another sector. For the total national economy, net lending (+) or borrowing (-) equals to resources that the economy made available to or borrowed from the rest of the world. In the general government sector, the government surplus or deficit (B.9) is evaluated in relation to the GDP according to the Maastricht criteria (3%). The B.9 item is a balancing item of the capital account and should correspond to the same item in the financial account, where it shows total changes in financial assets and liabilities. As a rule, there is a statistical discrepancy between the two approaches to the calculation of the balancing item. It reflects the use of different information sources, inaccuracies, errors, and mistakes involved in compiling and processing of data from accounting statements or statistical reports. There is also an influence of inconsistent adherence to the methodology for individual items. In the process of balancing, the final statistical discrepancy of respective non-financial and financial transactions is minimized; and, in the end, usually it is placed to other accounts receivable/payable (F.8). The net lending (+) or borrowing (-) (B.9) of the general government sector (S.13) express the deficit/surplus of the government institutions economy, which each EU member state submits to the European Commission for an assessment and approval.

Changes in net worth (B.10) express changes in the value of assets and liabilities during the accounting period. They summarise amounts captured in the accumulation accounts, i.e. changes in net worth due to saving and capital transfers, changes in net worth due to other changes in the volume of assets and changes in net worth due to nominal holding gains/losses.

External balance of goods and services (B.11) – if it is positive, there is a surplus for the rest of the world and a deficit for the total economy and vice versa if it is negative. Current external balance (B.12), positive or negative, is the result of transactions between resident and non-resident institutional units in primary and secondary distribution of income.

Net worth (B.90) – for the total national economy also the term national wealth is used. The net worth of the total national economy is the sum of net worth of institutional sectors. It is the value of non-financial assets of the total national economy plus the balance of financial assets and liabilities to the rest of the world (non-residents).

Valuation

Flows and stocks are valued at market prices; when no market prices are available (e.g. in the case of non-market services provided by the general government) valuation is made by summing production costs; they are expressed at current prices. Moreover, flows and stocks are also expressed at constant prices (i.e. at the prices of the previous period).

Due to transport costs, trade margins, and taxes on products less subsidies on products, the producer and the user of a given product usually perceive its value differently. In order to be as close to the views of both producers and customers as possible, the system records all uses at purchasers’ prices, which include transport costs, trade margins, and taxes less subsidies on products, while output is recorded at basic prices, which exclude those elements. Imports and exports of commodities are measured at prices at the border. Total imports and exports are valued at the exporter’s customs border, i.e. free on board (FOB). Foreign transport and insurance services between the exporter’s and importer’s borders are not included in the value of goods but are recorded under services.

Basic price is the price receivable by the producer from the purchaser for a unit of a good or service produced as output excluding tax payable on that unit as a consequence of its production or sale (i.e. taxes on products), but inclusive of subsidy received on that unit as a consequence of its production or sale (i.e. subsidies on products). It excludes transport margins invoiced separately by the producer and holding gains and losses from non-financial and financial assets. It includes all transport margins charged by the producer on the same invoice, even if they are included as a separate item on the invoice.

The purchaser’s price is the price the purchaser actually pays for a product at the time of purchase. It is composed of the basic price plus and minus the following items:
plus taxes less subsidies on the products (but excluding deductible taxes like VAT on the products);
plus transport charges paid separately by the purchaser to take delivery at the required time and place;
minus deductions for any discounts for bulk or off-peak purchases from standard prices or charges;
minus interest or service charges added under credit arrangements;
minus extra charges incurred as a result of failing to pay within the period stated at the time the purchases were made.
This valuation is in compliance with the methodology of the European System of Accounts (ESA 2010); see Chapter 1 (points 1.94 to 1.100) and Chapter 3 (points 3.06 and 3.44) of the ESA 2010 for details.
Notes on Tables
Tables 5-1 to 5-19 Income generation, distribution, and use indicators, assets and liabilities indicators
Goods and services account (Tables 5-1 and 5-2) shows real flows of goods and services in the economy. It covers total resources (output and imports) of goods and services and their uses broken down by intermediate consumption, final consumption, gross capital formation (of fixed capital, changes in inventories including valuables) and exports. It also records taxes on products and subsidies on products, as the output is valued at basic prices and uses are valued at purchasers’ prices.
There is a balance in the goods and services account (it has no balancing item). It is part of the national accounts for the total national economy.
FISIM (P.119), i.e. financial intermediation services indirectly measured, are the sum of two implicit fees paid by the borrower and the lender. FISIM are calculated as a difference between the reference rate and the rate actually paid to depositors and charged to borrowers. It only applies to loans and deposits of financial institutions (S.122 and S.125; excluding interbank loans and deposits) and it is included in their output. The same amount is allocated to the intermediate consumption of other institutional sectors/subsectors, to final consumption, or it is included in exports.
Tables 5-3 to 5-17 provide an overview of key macroeconomic indicators for the total national economy as well as broken down by economic activity and institutional sector. They characterize non-financial transactions (transactions in goods and services, distributive and capital transactions), financial transactions and balance sheet items (stocks). They also show the relation to the rest of the world, net worth including its changes, stocks of non-financial and financial assets, and stocks of liabilities.
Tables  5-18 and  5-19 General government deficit and general government debt            present in the form of time series
an overview of indicators which affect the deficit and debt of the general government sector (see institutional sectors) broken down by subsector. The definition of the general government deficit and debt complies with international standards and regulations of the EU authorities.
The deficit of general government budgets is the amount of net borrowing (-B.9) of the general government; the surplus of
general government budgets is the amount of net lending (+B.9) of the general government. The B.9 value of net lending (+)
or borrowing (-) provides the basis for an assessment of the budget implementation of the general government according to
the Maastricht criteria (3% of GDP). For this purpose (Excessive deficit procedure, EDP), the B.9 indicator is not modified by
interest on swap operations and operations in forward rate agreement interest to the so-called EDP B.9. The D.4, D.7, and D.9
items are consolidated, i.e. transfers within each of the subsectors of the general government are excluded.
Calculation of the general government debt is based on the ESA 2010 methodology and on the Manual on the Government
Deficit and Debt and it is evaluated in relation to the GDP, according to the Maastricht criteria (60% of GDP). The
general government debt (in nominal value) is the sum of payables resulting from received currency and deposits, issued debt
securities, and loans (AF.2+AF.3+AF.4). Received deposits (as part of the general government debt of the CR) were only
reported from 2001 to 2006, due to classification of the Czech Consolidation Agency in S.13. At present, received deposits are
part of the general government debt again, due to classification of the Czech Export Bank, the National Development Bank
(former name the Czech-Moravian Guarantee and Development Bank), and the Financial Market Guarantee System (former
name the Deposit Insurance Fund) into S.1311 (in compliance with the ESA 2010 methodology).
Table 5-20 Detailed tax and social contribution receipts of the general government sector
Current taxes (D.2 and D.5), capital taxes (D.91), and net social contributions (D.61) to social and health insurance, which are
the source of income of the general government sector (subsectors). The data are in compliance with national accounts data
for S.13 and the ESA 2010 rules. The calculation is based on the time-shift method, which allows eliminating of the effect of
taxes (tax “income”) that are unlikely to be collected. In view of that the items under D.995 code are blank.
