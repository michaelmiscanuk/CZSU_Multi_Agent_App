Finance je důležitou součástí každého podnikání a ekonomiky. Zahrnuje správu peněz, investice, úvěry a další finanční operace. V dnešní době je finance klíčovým faktorem pro úspěch a růst firem.

V oblasti financí se často setkáváme s různými ukazateli a čísly, které nám pomáhají hodnotit výkonnost a stabilitu. Například, hodnota 55.409 může představovat určitou finanční metriku, jako je zisk, obrat nebo jiný důležitý ukazatel.

Je důležité sledovat tyto ukazatele a analyzovat je v kontextu celkového hospodářského prostředí.

Metodické vysvětlivky
Údaje uvedené v tabulkách 6-1 až 6-12 byly převzaty z Ministerstva financí a údaje v tabulce 6-13 z Ministerstva obrany.

Poznámky k tabulkám
Tab. 6-1 až 6-4 Hospodaření veřejných rozpočtů
V tabulkách 6-1 až 6-4 jsou uvedeny konsolidované výsledky hospodaření veřejných rozpočtů, tj. státního rozpočtu (včetně operací na účtech Národního fondu, který spravuje prostředky EU, a zdrojů z privatizace), mimorozpočtových fondů: tj. státních fondů (Státní zemědělský intervenční fond, Státní fond životního prostředí, Státní fond kultury, Státní fond kinematografie (do 31. prosince 2012 Státní fond pro podporu a rozvoj české kinematografie), Státní fond podpory investic (do 31. května 2020 Státní fond rozvoje bydlení) a Státní fond dopravní infrastruktury) a Pozemkového fondu (zrušen k 31. prosinci 2012; jeho právním nástupcem je k 1. lednu 2013 Státní pozemkový úřad), fondů sociálního zabezpečení (veřejné zdravotní pojištění) a místních rozpočtů (tj. krajů, obcí, dobrovolných svazků obcí a do roku 2021 Regionálních rad regionů soudržnosti).

Konsolidace výsledků hospodaření veřejných rozpočtů je postup, při němž dochází k vyloučení vzájemných přerozdělovacích operací mezi složkami vlády tak, aby byla získána nezkreslená informace o celkových objemech všech vládních transakcí provedených pouze vůči zbytku ekonomiky.

Zdrojová data pro zpracování jsou čerpána z účetních a finančních výkazů jednotlivých složek veřejných rozpočtů, údajů státního závěrečného účtu a výročních zpráv mimorozpočtových fondů. Údaje jsou kompilovány podle metodiky Mezinárodního měnového fondu v souladu s Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFS 2014). Pokrytí veřejných rozpočtů a použitá metodika zpracování jsou zdrojem rozdílů ve struktuře, popř. objemech příjmů a výdajů v tabulkách 6-1 až 6-4 a 6-5 až 6-12 (Metodika GFS 2014 vylučuje z příjmů splátky půjček a z výdajů poskytnuté půjčky, které jsou klasifikovány jako financování. Dále klasifikuje poplatky za ukládání odpadů jako nedaňové příjmy.)

Metodika GFS 2014 využívá akruální i cash princip. Tabulky 6-1 až 6-3 zachycují peněžní toky. Vymezení institucí pro tabulku hotovostních toků je v současné době užší, než jak je stanoveno plné pokrytí v GFS 2014 (shodné s ESA 2010). Dluh v tabulce 6-4 je uveden v nominální hodnotě.

Vzhledem k metodickým změnám (implementace GFS 2014) od 1. září 2016 nejsou údaje v tabulkách 6-1 až 6-4 plně srovnatelné s údaji publikovanými ve statistických ročenkách předcházejících Statistické ročence České republiky 2017. Tabulky 6-1 a 6-2 obsahují druhové třídění příjmů a výdajů veřejných rozpočtů. Tabulka 6-3 obsahuje výdaje tříděné podle funkcí veřejných rozpočtů podle metodiky schválené Statistickou komisí Spojených národů – Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG). V tabulce 6-4 je zachycena zadluženost jednotlivých složek veřejných rozpočtů, respektive celkový konsolidovaný vládní dluh k 31. prosinci vykazovaného roku podle dluhových nástrojů.

Tab. 6-5 až 6-12 Rozpočet a státní fondy
Údaje uváděné v tabulkách 6-5 až 6-12 jsou každoročně přebírány ze státního závěrečného účtu České republiky. Vyjadřují dosažené výsledky hospodaření státního rozpočtu České republiky, místních rozpočtů a státních fondů. Výsledky hospodaření státního rozpočtu uvedené ve státním závěrečném účtu navazují na údaje finančních výkazů organizačních složek státu k 31. prosinci příslušného roku a na údaje České národní banky o pokladním plnění státního rozpočtu ke stejnému datu.

V tabulkách 6-5 až 6-8 jsou uvedeny výsledky hospodaření státního rozpočtu v členění podle platné rozpočtové skladby, v tabulkách 6-9 až 6-11 jsou uvedeny výsledky hospodaření místních rozpočtů (tj. krajů, obcí a dobrovolných svazků obcí celkem, do roku 2021 pak včetně Regionálních rad regionů soudržnosti). Tab. 6-12 obsahuje přehled hospodaření státních fondů, včetně dotací poskytnutých ze státního rozpočtu.

Tab. 6-13 Vojenské výdaje podle druhů nákladů a směrů určení
Údaje jsou v souladu se standardizovaným hlášením vojenských výdajů podle metodiky OSN a vychází ze státního závěrečného účtu České republiky za rok 2023, kapitola Ministerstvo obrany.

Methodological notes
Data given in Tables 6-1 to 6-12 were provided by the Ministry of Finance and data in Table 6-13 by the Ministry of Defence.

Notes on Tables
Tables 6-1 to 6-4 General government operations
Tables 6-1 to 6-4 give consolidated general government operations, i.e. the state budget (including resources from privatisation and transactions on the accounts of the National Fund, which administers resources from EU funds), extrabudgetary funds, i.e. state funds (the State Agricultural Intervention Fund, the State Environmental Fund, the State Culture Fund, the Czech Film Fund (before 1 January 2013 the State Fund for Support and Development of Czech Cinematography), the State Investment Promotion Fund (the State Housing Development Fund until 31 May 2020), and the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure) and the Land Fund (discontinued as at 31 December 2012; the State Land Office is its legal successor since 1 January 2013), social security funds (public health insurance), and local governments (i.e. budgets of Regions, municipalities, voluntary unions of municipalities, and before 2022 of regional councils of cohesion regions).

The consolidation of general government operations is a method eliminating all transactions and reciprocal stock positions among the government units to obtain unbiased information on total volumes of all government transactions made only in relation to non-government units. The source data for the processing are taken from accounting and financial statements of individual general government institutions, the State Final Account, and annual reports of extrabudgetary funds. The data are compiled according to the methodology of the International Monetary Fund in accordance with the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM 2014). The differences in the structure or the volumes of revenue and expenditure (expense) in Tables 6-1 to 6-4 and 6-5 to 6-12 are due to the coverage of general government and the methodology used for processing. (The GFSM 2014 methodology excludes loan repayments from revenue and from expense it excludes lending, because both are classified as financing. Further, waste deposit charges are classified as non-tax revenue.)

The GFSM 2014 methodology uses both accrual and cash principle. Tables 6-1 to 6-3 capture cash flows. The definition of institutions for the cash flow table is narrower now than the full coverage determined in the GFSM 2014 (the same as in the ESA 2010). Table 6-4 shows debt in the nominal value. Since 1 September 2016, due to methodological changes (implementation of the GFSM 2014), data in Tables 6-1 to 6-4 are not fully comparable to data published in statistical yearbooks preceding the Statistical Yearbook of the Czech Republic 2017.

Tables 6-1 and 6-2 list revenue and expenditure (expense) of general government by kind. Table 6-3 contains expenditure broken down by function of general government according to the Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG) adopted by the UN Statistical Commission. Table 6-4 shows debt of individual general government components and the total consolidated general government debt as at 31 December of the reported year by type of debt instrument.

Tables 6-5 to 6-12 Budget and state funds
The data given in Tables 6-5 to 6-12 are taken from the State Final Account of the Czech Republic every year and show the financial performance of the state budget of the Czech Republic, local governments, and state funds. The state budget performance results given in the State Final Account follow up the data reported in financial statements of organisational units of the state as at 31 December of the respective year and the Czech National Bank’s state budget performance data as at the same date. Tables 6-5 to 6-8 present the state budget performance results broken down by the valid budget classification, Tables 6-9 to 6-11 show performance results of local governments (i.e. budgets of Regions, municipalities, and voluntary unions of municipalities in total, before 2022 including regional councils of cohesion regions). Table 6-12 shows the financial performance of state funds, including subsidies provided from the state budget.

Table 6-13 Defence expenditure by type of costs and use
The data comply with the standardised reporting of defence (military) expenditure according to the methodology of the United Nations and come from the State Final Account of the Czech Republic for 2023, Chapter Ministry of Defence.

Měna a platební bilance (Currency and balance of payments) jsou klíčovými ukazateli ekonomického zdraví země. Česká národní banka (ČNB) pravidelně zveřejňuje údaje o měnových rezervách a platební bilanci, které poskytují důležité informace o stavu české ekonomiky.

V roce 1996 byla měnová bilance České republiky (ČR) vyjádřena v korunách českých (CZK). Celková měnová bilance dosáhla hodnoty 5000 korun českých. Tento údaj je důležitý pro analýzu ekonomických trendů a stabilitu měny.

Platební bilance zahrnuje všechny transakce mezi rezidenty a nerezidenty, což zahrnuje obchod se zbožím a službami, příjmy a transfery. Tyto informace jsou klíčové pro pochopení mezinárodních ekonomických vztahů a vlivu na domácí ekonomiku.

Metodické vysvětlivky
Údaje uváděné v této kapitole byly převzaty z České národní banky (ČNB). Ve všech tabulkách, kde jsou uvedeny názvy výkazů, se jedná o vyčerpávající šetření, v ostatních případech jsou použity kvalifikované odhady a dopočty.

Poznámky k tabulkám
Tab. 7-1 Peněžní agregáty a protipoložky
Peněžní agregáty a jejich protipoložky jsou souhrnnou statistickou bilancí měnových finančních institucí (MFI), která poskytuje uživatelům základní přehled o pozici sektoru MFI vůči ostatním rezidentským a nerezidentským sektorům. Peněžní agregáty představují množství peněz v ekonomice a jsou propočteny z pasiv měnového charakteru rezidentských měnových finančních institucí (tzv. sektoru tvorby peněz) vůči jiným rezidentským sektorům (tzv. sektoru držby peněz). Sektor držby peněz zahrnuje všechny rezidenty České republiky jiné než MFI (mimo ústřední vládní instituce). Kromě domácností a neziskových institucí sloužících domácnostem sem patří nefinanční podniky a finanční instituce, které nejsou MFI, spolu s místními vládními institucemi a fondy sociálního zabezpečení. MFI v podmínkách České republiky tvoří centrální banka (S.121) a ostatní měnové finanční instituce (S.122 a S.123) – tj. banky, fondy peněžního trhu a družstevní záložny. Ústřední vládní instituce jsou považovány za sektor tzv. měnově neutrální. Peněžní agregáty se liší podle stupně likvidity jednotlivých složek. Úzký peněžní agregát M1 obsahuje oběživo a jednodenní vklady. Střední peněžní agregát M2 zahrnuje peněžní agregát M1, vklady s výpovědní lhůtou do tří měsíců a vklady se splatností do dvou let. Široký peněžní agregát M3 obsahuje peněžní agregát M2 a obchodovatelné nástroje, které tvoří podílové listy/akcie fondů peněžního trhu, emitované dluhové cenné papíry se splatností do dvou let a repo operace. Hlavními protipoložkami peněžních agregátů jsou: Dlouhodobější finanční pasiva, která zahrnují vklady s výpovědní lhůtou nad 3 měsíce, vklady se splatností nad 2 roky, emitované dluhové cenné papíry nad 2 roky, kapitál a rezervy. Úvěry vládním institucím (S.13) podle klasifikace ESA 2010 včetně nakoupených dluhových a majetkových cenných papírů emitovaných těmito institucemi. Úvěry soukromému sektoru (S.11+S.124+S.125+S.126+S.127+S.128+S.129+S.14+S.15) podle klasifikace ESA 2010 včetně nakoupených dluhových a majetkových cenných papírů emitovaných těmito institucemi. Čistá zahraniční aktiva, která zahrnují zahraniční aktiva MFI České republiky (jako měnové zlato, hotovost jiná než Kč, cenné papíry emitované nerezidenty ČR a úvěry poskytnuté nerezidentům ČR) minus zahraniční pasiva MFI České republiky (jako vklady v držbě nerezidentů ČR, repo operace, podílové listy / akcie fondů peněžního trhu a dluhové cenné papíry s dobou splatnosti do dvou let emitované MFI a v držení nerezidentů). Základem pro sestavení peněžních agregátů a jejich protipoložek v České republice je harmonizovaná konsolidovaná rozvaha sektoru MFI. Sestavuje se jako součet rozvahy centrální banky a agregované rozvahy ostatních měnových finančních institucí s vyloučením vzájemných vztahů v oblasti úvěrů a vkladů, včetně neobchodovatelných cenných papírů, snížením emitovaného oběživa o hotovost na pokladnách MFI a snížením závazků měnových finančních institucí z emisí ostatních dluhových cenných papírů a majetkových cenných papírů o částky těchto nástrojů v držbě měnových finančních institucí na straně aktiv. Zdrojem dat pro sestavování konsolidované bilance MFI jsou údaje přebírané z výkazů měnové a bankovní statistiky doplněné o vlastní propočty ČNB. Metodika zjišťování (statistické principy, definice sektorů, klasifikace instrumentů, způsob výpočtu meziročních změn) je sladěna s evropskými i dalšími mezinárodními standardy (nařízení a doporučení ECB, Manuál měnové a finanční statistiky MMF atd.).

Výpočet míry růstu
Míra růstu pro referenční období se počítá z objemů měsíčních finančních transakcí a ze zůstatkových hodnot na počátku každého z měsíců. Měsíční transakce jsou počítány z rozdílů zůstatkových hodnot očištěných o reklasifikace, ostatní přecenění, pohyby směnných kurzů a případně ostatní změny, které nejsou důsledkem transakcí. Tato data pak odrážejí pouze ty změny, které vznikají z přijímání finančních aktiv, nebo poskytování finančních pasiv. Reklasifikace a ostatní netransakční korekce jsou v transakční statistice zaváděny z toho důvodu, aby byla zachována srovnatelnost postupných sledování a tím umožněny výpočty indexů předpokládaných zůstatků sledovaných hodnot a odvození jejich míry růstu.

2. Roční míra růstu pro měsíc t, tj. změna za posledních 12 měsíců končící měsícem t se počítá jako součin dvanácti součinitelů každého předchozího měsíce. Výpočet roční míry růstu na základě meziměsíčních měr růstu tak umožňuje zohlednit transakční změny a netransakční vlivy v jednotlivých měsících:
11       F M
(b)         aₜ =    1 +      t i L      1  100
i=₀             t 1 i
kde
F  t M – transakce v měsíci t
F  t M = (L t - L t-1) - C t M - Et M - Vt M
a
L  t – zůstatek na konci měsíce t
C  t M – reklasifikace v měsíci t
E  t M  – změny směnných kurzů v měsíci t
V  t M  – změny ocenění v měsíci t
Míry růstu pro jiná referenční období se odvozují od vzorce (b).

Tab. 7-2 Měnová báze ČNB
Měnová báze (rezervní peníze) zahrnuje oběživo a rezervy, které drží obchodní banky a družstevní záložny (od roku 2012) na účtech u centrální banky. Obě tyto položky představují užití měnové báze. Měnová báze vyjadřuje vztahy centrální banky vůči ostatním sektorům v ekonomice. Proto protipoložky měnové báze představují vnější sektor, sektor vládních institucí, bankovní sektor a nebankovní sektor. Tyto faktory ovlivňující výši měnové báze se označují jako zdroje měnové báze.

Vnější sektor představuje saldo krátkodobých a dlouhodobých pohledávek a závazků centrální banky ve vztahu k nerezidentům v domácí měně i v zahraničních měnách. Vzhledem k nevýznamné výši tato položka zahrnuje i devizovou pozici ve vztahu k rezidentům.

Sektor vládních institucí vyjadřuje rozdíl mezi aktivy a pasivy centrální banky vůči sektoru vládních institucí. Garanční systém finančního trhu zahrnuje Fond pojištění vkladů a Fond pro řešení krize.

Pohledávky za nebankovními subjekty představují pohledávky centrální banky vůči různým nebankovním subjektům. Mezi ně patří např. banky bez licence.

Čistá ostatní aktiva zahrnují různé jiné položky, např. vlastní prostředky centrální banky, hmotný a nehmotný majetek, pohledávky za obchodními bankami z titulu čerpání oběživa, ostatní vklady obchodních bank u centrální banky, ostatní nevládní vklady, nevládní cenné papíry a účasti atd.

Objem realizovaných operací vyjadřuje sterilizaci volné likvidity, tj. objem poukázek ČNB v držení obchodních bank, družstevních záložen, ostatních nebankovních subjektů a ministerstva financí.

Standby facility: zápůjční a depozitní facility se splatností jeden den, které umožňují jednotlivým bankám a družstevním záložnám (od roku 2012) doladit svou denní rezervní pozici tak, aby docházelo k optimalizaci výše zůstatku na účtu platebního styku.

– Lombardní repo (zápůjční facilita): repo operace sloužící k dodání likvidity obchodním bankám a družstevním záložnám (od roku 2012). Při poskytnutí úvěru se uplatňuje 100% krytí cennými papíry, zpravidla státními pokladničními poukázkami a poukázkami ČNB. Úvěr je úročen lombardní sazbou. Minimální objem není stanoven.

– Overnight (O/N) depozitum (depozitní facilita): obchodní banky a družstevní záložny (od roku 2012) mají možnost uložit si volné prostředky u centrální banky. Jedná se o nezajištěný vklad, je úročen diskontní sazbou. Minimální objem je stanoven na 10 mil. Kč.

Oběživo představuje závazek centrální banky z titulu vydaných bankovek a mincí, které se nacházejí v pokladnách bank, družstevních záložen (od roku 2012) a u nebankovní veřejnosti.

Rezervy bank a družstevních záložen (od roku 2012) zahrnují povinné minimální rezervy a volné rezervy na účtech u centrální banky:

Měna a platební bilance
Currency and balance of payments
– Povinné minimální rezervy jsou banky a družstevní záložny (od roku 2012) povinny držet na účtech u centrální banky. Předepsaný objem činí 2 % z primárních závazků bank se splatností do dvou let, a to v české a zahraniční měně. Povinné minimální rezervy jsou udržovány v měsíčních cyklech, jsou úročeny platnou repo sazbou.
– Volné rezervy představují rozdíl mezi předepsaným a skutečným objemem povinných minimálních rezerv.

Tab. 7-7 Průměrné úrokové sazby na trhu mezibankovních depozit (roční průměry)
PRIBOR (Prague Interbank Offered Rates) jsou referenční úrokové sazby na trhu mezibankovních depozit vypočítané na základě kotací vybraných bank (dále jen referenční banky). Fixing kotací úrokových sazeb je prováděn ČNB denně v 11:00 hodin. Kotací se rozumí zveřejnění orientační ceny, za kterou jsou banky ochotny depozita prodat ve standardním objemu standardní protistraně. ČNB definuje termíny, pro které jsou sazby PRIBOR stanovovány, algoritmus pro jejich výpočet, složení referenčních bank, standardní protistrany, standardní objem a způsob zveřejňování kotací. Sazby PRIBOR se stanovují pro následující splatnosti: 1 den (overnight), 1 a 2 týdny, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 a 12 měsíců a vypočítávají se z kotací referenčních bank na trhu mezibankovních depozit následujícím způsobem:
– kotuje-li úrokovou sazbu pro danou splatnost více než pět referenčních bank, odstraní se nejvyšší kotace (popř. jedna z nejvyšších kotací) a nejnižší kotace (popř. jedna z nejnižších kotací) a PRIBOR se vypočte jako aritmetický průměr ze zbylých kotací zaokrouhlený na dvě desetinná místa;
– kotují-li úrokovou sazbu pro danou splatnost čtyři nebo pět referenčních bank, vypočte se PRIBOR jako aritmetický průměr ze všech kotací zaokrouhlený na dvě desetinná místa;
– kotuje-li úrokovou sazbu pro některou splatnost méně než čtyři referenční banky, sazby PRIBOR se pro tuto splatnost nestanovují.
ČNB zveřejňuje sazby PRIBOR denně v Hospodářských novinách a prostřednictvím agentur Reuters, Telerate a Bloomberg. Počet a složení referenčních bank je uveden v poznámkách k jednotlivým tabulkám historických hodnot sazeb PRIBOR.
Tab. 7-8 Repo sazba, diskontní sazba a lombardní sazba
Hlavní měnový nástroj má podobu repo operací prováděných formou tendrů. Při repo operacích ČNB přijímá od bank přebytečnou likviditu a bankám předává jako kolaterál dohodnuté cenné papíry. Obě strany se zároveň zavazují, že po uplynutí doby splatnosti proběhne reverzní transakce, v níž ČNB jako dlužník vrátí věřitelské bance zapůjčenou jistinu zvýšenou o dohodnutý úrok a věřitelská banka vrátí ČNB poskytnutý kolaterál. Základní doba trvání těchto operací je stanovena na 14 dní, avšak v závislosti na predikci vývoje likvidity bankovního sektoru jsou čas od času prováděny i repo operace s dobou splatnosti kratší než 14 dní. Vzhledem k systémovému přebytku likvidity v bankovním sektoru slouží v současné době repo tendry pouze k odčerpávání likvidity. ČNB provádí repo tendry s tzv. variabilní sazbou. To znamená, že vyhlášená repo sazba slouží jako maximální limitní sazba, za kterou mohou být banky v repo tendru uspokojovány. Nabídky bank jsou vypořádány podle americké aukční procedury, tj. ČNB přijme přednostně nabídky požadující nejnižší úrokovou sazbu, a to až do výše predikovaného přebytku likvidity na daný den. V případě, že objem objednaný bankami přesáhne predikovaný přebytek likvidity, ČNB nabídky za nejvyšší sazby buď zcela odmítne, nebo proporcionálně zkrátí. Repo tendr je obvykle vyhlašován každý pracovní den kolem 9:30 hod. Banky mají možnost ve stanovené době předávat své objednávky, tj. objem a požadovanou úrokovou sazbu. Minimální akceptovatelný objem je 300 mil. Kč a dále celé násobky 100 mil. Kč. Diskontní sazba je základní sazba ČNB. Za tuto sazbu poskytovala ČNB do 30. září 1997 směnečné úvěry bankám. Po jejich zrušení se od roku 1998 úročí diskontní sazbou depozitní facility, které představují nezajištěná overnight depozita, jež může u ČNB umístit jakákoliv česká banka před uzávěrkou účetního dne. Minimální objem těchto depozit je 10 mil. Kč.

Lombardní sazba je sazba, za kterou ČNB poskytuje lombardní úvěr. Lombardní úvěr se poskytuje proti zástavě vybraných cenných papírů zveřejněných v Seznamu cenných papírů přijímaných do zástavy ČNB pro účely poskytování lombardního úvěru.

Tab. 7-9 a 7-10 Průměrné úrokové sazby z korunových klientských úvěrů a vkladů
Průměrné sazby z korunových vkladů a úvěrů přijatých/poskytnutých bankami od klientů/klientům. Průměrné sazby jsou stanoveny jako vážený průměr, kde vahami jsou objemy v příslušných kategoriích vkladů a úvěrů. Od roku 2004 je metodika sladěna s požadavky Nařízení Evropské centrální banky (EU) č. 1072/2013 ze dne 24. září 2013 o statistice úrokových sazeb uplatňovaných měnovými finančními institucemi (přepracované znění) (ECB/2013/34). Sledované úrokové sazby nejsou nadále sjednané nominální sazby, ale sazby sjednané a přepočtené na roční základ.

Stavy obchodů jsou definovány jako bilanční zůstatky přijatých, resp. poskytnutých vkladů a úvěrů bankou k okamžiku vykazování. Jsou členěny podle původní sjednané doby splatnosti. V roce 2004 byla zavedena statistika nových obchodů. Novým obchodem se rozumí jakákoliv nová dohoda mezi bankou a klientem v daném období (bez ohledu na počátek čerpání). Nové úvěrové obchody jsou členěny podle původní doby fixace úrokové sazby. Rozumí se jí období na počátku kontraktu, během kterého se výše úrokové sazby nemůže měnit.

Nové úvěrové obchody jsou pro sektor domácností a NISD pak v tabulce 7-9 dále členěny dle kategorie nového obchodu na:
– Čisté nové úvěry včetně navýšení – obsahují úvěry, které v daném měsíci vstoupily do ekonomiky poprvé. Součástí je i navýšení k refinancovaným úvěrům i ostatním novým ujednáním.
– Refinancované úvěry – obsahují úvěry, které byly již dříve poskytnuty jinou institucí než vykazující bankou a na jejichž nesplacenou část je znovu uzavřena úvěrová smlouva u vykazující banky. Jestliže při refinancování úvěru došlo zároveň k navýšení úvěru, tato kategorie pak obsahuje pouze objem nenavýšené části nového refinancovaného úvěru. Navýšení je součástí čistých nových úvěrů. V této položce se dále vykazují konsolidované úvěry, jejichž původním věřitelem byla jiná instituce.
– Ostatní nová ujednání ke stávajícím úvěrům – obsahují úvěry, které byly již dříve poskytnuty vykazující bankou a došlo u nich pouze k novému ujednání (např. refixace úrokové sazby u úvěrů na bydlení). Dále se v této položce vykazují konsolidované úvěry, jejichž původním věřitelem je jak jiná/jiné instituce, tak i vykazující banka nebo případně pouze vykazující banka. Případné navýšení úvěru je analogicky jako u refinancovaných úvěrů součástí kategorie čistých nových úvěrů.

U ukazatelů – jednodenní vklady, vklady s výpovědní lhůtou, vklady na běžných účtech a přečerpání bankovních účtů – se nové obchody shodují se stavy. Zdrojem dat jsou výkazy úrokové statistiky, které banky předkládají ČNB.

Údaje jsou převzaty z informačního systému JERRS (Seznamy regulovaných a registrovaných subjektů). Banky jsou rozděleny do skupin podle přímého vlastnictví.

Tab. 7-12 Platební bilance
Platební bilance zachycuje ekonomické transakce se zahraničím (tj. mezi rezidenty a nerezidenty) za určité časové období. Základní struktura platební bilance vycházející z Příručky k sestavování platební bilance MMF (6. vydání, 2009) zahrnuje běžný, kapitálový a finanční účet včetně změny rezervních aktiv.

V běžném účtu jsou zachyceny toky zboží (vývoz a dovoz v národním pojetí podle metodiky platební bilance) a služeb (vývoz a dovoz služeb zpracování, oprav a údržby, dopravních služeb, služeb v zahraničním cestovním ruchu a ostatních obchodních a neobchodních služeb), prvotní důchody z kapitálu, investic a práce (úroky, dividendy, reinvestované zisky, pracovní příjmy a část odvodů a dotací ve vztahu k rozpočtu Evropské unie) a kompenzující položky k reálným a finančním zdrojům poskytnutým či získaným bez protihodnoty (druhotné důchody jako např. dotace a odvody ve vztahu k rozpočtu a dalším fondům Evropské unie, penze, zahraniční pomoc, příspěvky aj.).

Kapitálový účet tvoří převody kapitálového charakteru související s promíjením dluhů, vlastnickými právy k fixním aktivům, investiční granty především z rozpočtu a dalších fondů Evropské unie metodicky vykazované na kapitálovém účtu, a převody nevyráběných, nefinančních hmotných aktiv (např. půda – pozemky pro zastupitelské úřady) a nehmotných práv (patenty, licence, autorská práva, obchody s emisními povolenkami aj.).

Finanční účet zahrnuje transakce spojené se vznikem, zánikem a změnou vlastnictví finančních aktiv a pasiv vlády, bankovní a podnikové sféry a ostatních subjektů ve vztahu k zahraničí. Poskytuje informace o finančních (kapitálových) tocích v členění na přímé investice (základní kapitál a reinvestování zisku, dluhové nástroje), portfoliové investice majetkového a dluhového charakteru, finanční deriváty, ostatní investice a rezervní aktiva. Základní členění ostatních investic je podle používaného finančního instrumentu (majetkové a dluhové cenné papíry, oběživo a depozita, půjčky, pojistné, penzijní a standardizované zárukové programy, obchodní úvěry a zálohy, jiné pohledávky a závazky, a zvláštní práva čerpání), podle časového hlediska (dlouhodobé, krátkodobé) a podle základních sektorů (ČNB, obchodní banky, vláda a ostatní sektory).

V položce rezervní aktiva jsou zaznamenány transakce se zahraničními aktivy centrální banky. Jedná se o snadno mobilizovatelná aktiva využitelná především jako zdroj přímého financování platební nerovnováhy i nepřímé regulace velikosti této nerovnováhy prostřednictvím intervencí na devizovém trhu. Rezervní aktiva jsou zahrnuta ve finančním účtu platební bilance.

Chyby a opomenutí jsou dopočtovou položkou mezi výsledným saldem běžného a kapitálového účtu na jedné straně a saldem finančního účtu na straně druhé. Představují saldo neidentifikovaných toků v běžném, kapitálovém a finančním účtu. Podkladem pro sestavení platební bilance jsou údaje vývozu a dovozu v národním pojetí dle metodiky platební bilance, údaje z výkazů bankovních a nebankovních subjektů, informace z administrativních zdrojů od centrálních orgánů a dalších institucí, a dále vlastní propočty ČNB.

Tab. 7-13 a 7-14 Přímé zahraniční investice do České republiky podle zemí a činností. Vykazované údaje zachycují příliv (tok) přímých zahraničních investic do České republiky v daném období. V souvislosti se zavedením šestého vydání Manuálu k sestavování platební bilance a investiční pozice vůči zahraničí (v roce 2014) došlo u přímých zahraničních investic ke změnám v prezentaci dat. Výstupy jsou členěny podle principu aktiv/pasiv. Na straně aktiv jsou zachyceny úvěrové vztahy s podniky ve skupině přímé investice (změna poskytnutých úvěrů). Na straně pasiv jsou zahrnuty vklady do základního kapitálu včetně reinvestovaných zisků a úvěrové vztahy s podniky ve skupině přímé investice (změna přijatých úvěrů). Položka NETTO zachycuje čistý příliv přímých zahraničních investic od nerezidentů do České republiky (pasiva snížená o aktiva). Prezentace přílivu přímých zahraničních investic je v teritoriální struktuře (země bezprostředního investora) a v odvětvovém členění (Klasifikace ekonomických činností NACE Rev. 2).

Za přímou zahraniční investici se považuje taková přeshraniční investice, která odráží záměr nerezidenta (přímého investora) získat trvalou účast v podniku přímé investice v České republice. Trvalá účast implikuje existenci dlouhodobého vztahu mezi přímým investorem a přímou investicí a významný vliv na řízení podniku. Údaje o přímých zahraničních investicích jsou vypracovány na základě informací a podkladů ve formě statistických výkazů nebankovních subjektů vyplývajících z § 41, odst. 1, písm. c) zákona č. 6/1993 Sb., o České národní bance a ve znění pozdějších předpisů. Obsah, formu, lhůty a způsob sestavování a předkládání stanoví vyhláška č. 235/2013 Sb. Jako hlavní zdroj jsou využívány čtvrtletní výkazy o vybraných aktivech a pasivech vůči zahraničí a roční výkazy nefinančních podniků o stavech přímých investic v tuzemsku. Doplňujícími informačními zdroji jsou výkazy bankovních subjektů, informace z burzy cenných papírů, obchodní věstník a tisk.

Tab. 7-15 Investiční pozice vůči zahraničí. Investiční pozice vůči zahraničí poskytuje přehled o celkové skladbě finančních aktiv a pasiv jednotek národního hospodářství (rezidentů) ve vztahu k zahraničí (nerezidentům) k určitému datu. Investiční pozice odpovídá svou strukturou finančnímu účtu platební bilance; v aktivech i pasivech je členěna podle instrumentů na přímé investice (základní kapitál včetně reinvestovaného zisku a dluhové nástroje), portfoliové investice (majetkové a dluhové), finanční deriváty a ostatní investice, které jsou členěny podle finančních instrumentů (majetkové a dluhové cenné papíry, oběživo a depozita, půjčky, pojistné, penzijní a standardizované záruční programy, obchodní úvěry a zálohy, jiné pohledávky a závazky, a zvláštní práva čerpání), podle splatnosti (dlouhodobé a krátkodobé) a podle základních skupin institucionálních sektorů. Na straně aktiv jsou dále uvedeny rezervní aktiva ČNB. Zlato jako součást jejích rezerv (obdobně i zlato v držení obchodních bank) je od roku 2000 oceněno tržní cenou. Na straně pasiv jsou odděleně uvedeny závazky z alokace zvláštních práv čerpání. Saldo investiční pozice (tj. rozdíl mezi úhrnnými aktivy a pasivy) představuje čistý vztah vůči zahraničí (věřitelskou či dlužnickou pozici). Ve stavu aktiv a pasiv zachycených v investiční pozici k určitému datu se odrážejí vedle transakcí uskutečněných v předcházejících obdobích a vykázaných v platební bilanci – kurzové, cenové a další vlivy.

Zdroje dat pro sestavení investiční pozice jsou následující: Přímé investice – čtvrtletní šetření nefinančních podniků zaměřené na aktiva a pasiva a roční výkazy nefinančních podniků o stavech přímých investic v tuzemsku a v zahraničí. Portfoliové investice – měsíční výkaz měnových a ostatních finančních institucí, čtvrtletní šetření nefinančních podniků zaměřené na aktiva, měsíční výkaz obchodníků s cennými papíry (na účet zákazníka a na vlastní účet), oznámení tuzemců o emisích cenných papírů na zahraničních trzích a údaje SKD (Systém krátkodobých dluhopisů spravovaný ČNB). Získaná data jsou porovnávána s údaji CDCP (Centrální depozitář cenných papírů). Finanční deriváty – měsíční výkaz zahraničních aktiv a pasiv bankovního sektoru (ČNB a ostatní měnové finanční instituce), čtvrtletní výkazy zahraničních aktiv a pasiv sektoru nefinančních podniků, pojišťoven a centrální vlády a měsíční výkaz o aktivech a pasivech sektoru penzijních fondů. Ostatní investice – měsíční výkaz zahraničních aktiv a pasiv bankovního sektoru (ČNB a ostatní měnové finanční instituce), čtvrtletní šetření nefinančních podniků zaměřené na aktiva a pasiva (obchodní úvěry), měsíční výkaz o finančních úvěrech.

In the table titled "Zahraniční zadluženost České republiky" (Foreign Debt of the Czech Republic), foreign debt represents the state of financial liabilities (with a fixed maturity) of national economy units (residents) in relation to foreign entities (non-residents) as of a certain date. The value reflects the amounts drawn (based on contractual agreements) and unpaid (owed) amounts. This measure excludes equity investments, such as direct investments – equity capital including reinvested earnings, portfolio investments – equity securities, other participations, and derivatives.
The data sources for compiling foreign debt are the same as those for the investment position towards foreign countries (see methodology for table 7-15).

In the table titled "Rezervní aktiva" (Reserve Assets), reserve assets represent short-term (liquid) foreign assets of the Czech National Bank (ČNB) in convertible currencies, including deposits in foreign banks, loans provided, securities, currencies, and gold, special drawing rights, and reserve positions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). These assets are usable for financing and regulating balance of payments imbalances. The basis for their calculation is the balance sheet of the ČNB.

In the table titled "Indexy nominálního a reálného efektivního kurzu koruny" (Indices of Nominal and Real Effective Exchange Rate of the Crown), the nominal effective exchange rate of the crown (NEER) expressed as an index indicates appreciation (index above 100) or depreciation (index below 100) of the national currency against a basket of selected currencies over a certain period compared to a base period (year 2020). The calculations used the most common method of weighted geometric mean of nominal exchange rates, taking into account the weight shares of total exports and imports of countries that are among our most significant trading partners, whose share in the foreign trade of the Czech Republic accounts for approximately 90%. Besides Eurozone countries, considered with one weight share and the EUR rate, these include China, Poland, the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, Hungary, Russia, the United States, Switzerland, South Korea, Romania, Sweden, Japan, and Denmark. The weight shares were processed in two variants. The first variant, applied by the International Monetary Fund, relates to the entire turnover of foreign trade of the Czech Republic. The second variant, applied by the European Central Bank, relates only to four commodity groups of foreign trade of the Czech Republic, which include commodity groups (5-8) according to the United Nations classification – Standard International Trade Classification (SITC).

In the same table, the real effective exchange rate of the crown (REER) is one of the indicators of the development of the country's international competitiveness, generally understood as various measures of relative prices or costs expressed in a certain currency. From this perspective, an REER index above 100 signals a tendency towards decreasing competitiveness of the country compared to the base period, while a decrease in the REER index below 100 indicates an increase in the country's competitiveness compared to the base period (year 2020). The most common method of weighted geometric mean of the ratio of the nominal exchange rate index and price differential was used for the REER calculation, with weights being the shares of the largest trading partners in the turnover of foreign trade.
In constructing the REER index, consumer prices and producer prices of 12 countries outside the Eurozone and all Eurozone countries were used. Individual Eurozone countries are considered as one monetary and price area for calculations. The number of Eurozone countries changes according to the current state. The structure of countries and their weight shares are the same as the methodology for calculating the NEER index. In the first variant, the weights relate to the entire turnover of foreign trade, while in the second variant, the weight shares relate only to the turnover in commodity groups (5-8) according to the SITC classification.

Methodological notes
The source of the data presented in this chapter is the Czech National Bank. All tables where the titles of reports are given are exhaustive investigations. Otherwise, qualified estimates and calculations are used.

Notes on Tables
Table 7-1 Monetary aggregates and counterparts
The table on monetary aggregates and their counterparts is a concise balance sheet of monetary financial institutions (MFIs) providing users with a basic overview of the position of the MFI sector vis-à-vis other resident and non-resident sectors. Monetary aggregates represent the amount of money in the economy and are calculated from the monetary liabilities of resident monetary financial institutions (the money-creating sector) to other resident sectors (the money-holding sector). The money-holding sector comprises all Czech residents other than MFIs (excluding central government). In addition to households and NPISH, it includes non-financial corporations, financial corporations other than MFIs, local government and social security funds. In the Czech Republic, MFIs comprise the central bank (S.121) and other monetary financial institutions (S.122 and S.123), i.e. banks, money market funds and credit unions. Central government is considered to be a money-neutral sector.

Monetary aggregates differ according to the degree of liquidity of the individual components. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 comprises currency in circulation plus overnight deposits. The intermediate monetary aggregate M2 comprises M1, deposits redeemable at a period of notice of up to and including three months, and deposits with an agreed maturity of up to and including two years. The broad monetary aggregate M3 comprises M2 plus marketable instruments consisting of money market fund units/shares, debt securities with a maturity of up to and including two years, and repurchase agreements.

The main counterparts of the monetary aggregates are as follows: Longer-term financial liabilities, which comprise deposits redeemable at a period of notice of over three months, deposits with an agreed maturity of over two years, capital and reserves. Loans to general government (S.13) under the ESA 2010 classification, including purchased debt and equity securities issued by general government. Loans to the private sector (S.11+S.124+S.125+S.126+S.127+S.128+S.129+S.14+S.15) under the ESA 2010 classification, including purchased debt and equity securities issued by this sector. Net external assets, which comprise external assets of Czech MFIs (such as monetary gold, non-koruna cash, securities issued by non-residents and loans granted to non-residents) minus external liabilities of the Czech MFI sector (such as non-residents’ holdings of deposits, repurchase agreements, money market fund share certificates/shares, and debt securities with a maturity of up to and including two years issued by MFIs and held by non-residents).

Monetary aggregates and their counterparts in the Czech Republic are compiled on the basis of the harmonised consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector. It is the sum of the balance sheet of the central bank and the aggregated balance sheet of other monetary financial institutions excluding mutual loans and deposits, including non-marketable securities; cash at MFI cash desks is subtracted from issued currency in circulation and other debt, and equity securities held by MFIs on the asset side are subtracted from MFI liabilities arising from the issuance of such instruments. Money and banking statistics statements and the CNB’s own calculations are the data sources for the compilation of the MFI consolidated balance sheet.

The collection methodology (statistical principles, sector definitions, instrument classification, method of calculation of annual changes) is harmonised with European and international standards (ECB Regulations and Recommendations, IMF Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, etc.).

Calculation of growth rates
The growth rates for the reference period are calculated from the volumes of monthly financial transactions and the outstanding amounts at the beginning of each month. Monthly transactions are calculated from differences in outstanding amounts adjusted for reclassifications, other revaluations, exchange rate variations and other changes which do not arise from transactions. This data thus reflects only those changes that arise from accepting financial assets or providing financial liabilities. Reclassifications and other non-transaction corrections are introduced into the transaction statistics to preserve the comparability of the gradual monitoring results, thereby enabling calculation of the indices of expected outstanding balances of the monitored variables and determination of their growth rates.
[/X][P][X]
Měna a platební bilance
Currency and balance of payments

Method of calculation
1. The month-on-month percentage change at month t is calculated as:
(a) aᴹ = (F M t - L t-1) / L t-1 * 100
2. The annual growth rate for month t, i.e. the change for the last 12 months ending with month t, is calculated as the product of the twelve coefficients for each previous month. The calculation of the annual growth rate from the month-on-month growth rates thus enables transaction changes and non-transaction effects in the individual months to be taken into account:
(b) aₜ = (1 + Σ (F M t-i / L t-1) - 1) * 100
where
F M t – transactions in month t
F M t = (L t - L t-1) - C tM - E tM - V tM
and
L t – outstanding amount at the end of month t
C tM – reclassifications in month t
E tM – exchange rate variations in month t
V tM – valuation changes in month t
The growth rates for other reference periods are derived from formula (b).

Table 7-2 Monetary base of the CNB
The monetary base (reserve money) includes currency and reserves held by commercial banks and credit unions (since 2012) on accounts with the central bank. These items together constitute the use of the monetary base. The monetary base expresses the central bank’s relations with other sectors of the economy. The counterparts of the monetary base are therefore the external sector, the general government sector, the banking sector and the non-banking sector. These factors affecting the monetary base are referred to as the sources of the monetary base.

The external sector represents the balance of short-term and long-term assets and liabilities of the central bank vis-à-vis non-residents in the domestic currency and in foreign currencies. This item also includes the foreign exchange position vis-à-vis residents (domestic banks).

The general government sector expresses the difference between the assets and liabilities of the central bank vis-à-vis the general government sector.

The Financial Market Guarantee System includes the Deposit Insurance Fund and the Crisis Resolution Fund. Claims on non-bank entities represent the claims of the central bank on different non-bank entities. These include e.g. banks without licenses.

Other net assets include various items, for example the central bank’s own funds, tangible and intangible property, claims on commercial banks by virtue of drawing currency in circulation, other deposits of commercial banks with the central bank, other non-government deposits and non-government securities and participations, etc.

The volume of sterilisation expresses the volume of CNB bills held by commercial banks, credit unions, other non-bank entities and the Ministry of Finance.

Stand-by facilities include overnight lending and deposit facilities, which enable to manage the daily reserve position of banks and credit unions (since 2012) so that an optimum balance on the payment system account is maintained.
– Lombard repo (lending facility): a repo operation serving to provide liquidity to commercial banks and credit unions (since 2012). On granting the credit, 100% coverage by securities, as a rule Treasury bills and CNB bills, is required. Interest on the credit is calculated at the Lombard rate. The minimum volume is not stipulated.
– O/N deposit (deposit facility): commercial banks and credit unions (since 2012) have a possibility to deposit their free funds with the central bank. The deposit is not secured and is remunerated at the discount rate. The stipulated minimum volume is CZK 10 million.

Currency represents a liability of the central bank by virtue of issued banknotes and coins held by banks, credit unions (since 2012) and the non-bank public.

Reserves of banks and credit unions (since 2012) include required minimum reserves and excess reserves on accounts with the central bank:
– The required minimum reserves are the funds which banks and credit unions (since 2012) are obliged to maintain on their accounts with the central bank. The prescribed volume amounts to 2% of banks’ primary liabilities with a maturity of up to 2 years.

Tabulka 7-7 Průměrné mezibankovní nabídkové sazby (roční průměry)
PRIBOR (Prague Interbank Offered Rates) are reference interest rates on the interbank deposit market calculated on the basis of quotations of selected banks (hereinafter “reference banks”). The interest rates are fixed by the CNB daily at 11.00 a.m. Quotation means publication of an orientation price at which banks are willing to sell deposits in a standard volume to a standard counterparty. The CNB defines the maturities for which PRIBOR rates are set, the algorithm for their calculation, the reference bank structure, the standard counterparties, the standard volumes and the method of publishing quotations.

PRIBOR rates are set for the following maturities: overnight, 1 and 2 weeks, and 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. They are calculated from the reference banks’ quotations on the interbank deposit market in the following manner:
– if more than five reference banks quote an interest rate for a certain maturity, the highest quotation (or one of the highest quotations) and the lowest quotation (or one of the lowest quotations) are eliminated and the PRIBOR is calculated from the remaining quotations as the arithmetic mean rounded to two decimal places;
– if four or five reference banks quote an interest rate for a certain maturity, the PRIBOR is calculated from all quotations as an arithmetic mean rounded to two decimal places;
– if less than four reference banks quote an interest rate for a certain maturity, the PRIBOR is not set.

PRIBOR rates are published daily by the CNB in Hospodářské noviny and through the Reuters, Telerate and Bloomberg agencies. The number and structure of the reference banks are given in the notes appended to each table of historical PRIBOR rates.

Tabulka 7-8 Repo sazba, Diskontní sazba, Lombardní sazba
The main monetary policy instrument takes the form of repo tenders. The CNB accepts excess liquidity from banks and in return transfers eligible securities to them as collateral. The two parties agree to reverse the transaction at a future point in time, when the CNB as borrower repays the principal of the loan plus interest and the creditor bank returns the collateral to the CNB. The basic duration of these operations is 14 days, although repos with shorter maturities are executed from time to time depending on the forecasts of banking sector liquidity. Owing to the systemic liquidity surplus in the Czech banking sector, repo tenders are currently used exclusively for absorbing liquidity.

The CNB conducts variable rate tenders, which means that the declared repo rate serves as the maximum limit rate at which banks’ bids can be satisfied in the tender. The bids are settled using the American auction procedure, i.e. those with the lowest interest rate are satisfied as having priority and those with successively higher rates are accepted until the total predicted liquidity surplus for the day is exhausted. If the volume ordered by the banks exceeds the predicted surplus, the CNB either completely refuses the bids at the highest rate or reduces them pro rata. Repo tenders are usually announced every business day at around 9.30 a.m. Banks may submit their bids – i.e. the amounts of money and the interest rates at which they want to enter into transactions with the CNB – within a prescribed time. The minimum acceptable volume is CZK 300 million. Bids exceeding the minimum must be expressed as multiples of CZK 100 million.

The Diskontní sazba is a key CNB rate. Up to 30 September 1997, the CNB provided acceptance credits to banks at this rate. Since 1998, when these credits were abolished, the discount rate has been used for deposit facilities. These are non-collateralised overnight deposits with the CNB that any Czech bank may place before the end of the business day. The minimum amount is CZK 10 million.

The Lombardní sazba is the rate at which the CNB grants Lombard credit. Lombard credit is granted against a pledge of selected securities included in the “List of securities accepted by the CNB as collateral for Lombard credit”.

Tables 7-9 and 7-10 Average interest rates on CZK client loans and deposits
Average interest rates applied by banks on CZK-denominated deposits and loans vis-à-vis clients. The rates are calculated as weighted average where the weights are the volumes in the respective deposit and loan categories. The methodology was harmonised with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 1072/2013 of the European Central Bank of 24 September 2013 concerning statistics on interest rates applied by monetary financial institutions (recast) (ECB/2013/34). Since then the interest rates have been reported as annualised agreed rates instead of nominal agreed rates. The outstanding amounts are defined as outstanding balances of deposits accepted and loans granted by the bank at the time of reporting, broken down by original agreed maturity. Statistics relating to new business were launched in 2004. New business includes all new agreements between bank and client in the reference period (regardless of the start of drawdown). New business is broken down by original interest rate fixation period, i.e. a period at the start of the contract during which the interest rate cannot be changed.

In Table 7-9 new business for households and NPISHs is further broken down by category into:
– Net new loans including increases – loans which entered the economy in the given month for the first time. Also includes increases in refinanced loans and other renegotiations.
– Refinanced loans – loans provided earlier by an institution other than the reporting bank and for the outstanding amount of which a new loan agreement has been signed with the reporting bank. In cases where the loan was increased when it was refinanced, this category only contains the non-increased portion of the new refinanced loan. The increase forms part of net new loans. This item also includes consolidated loans whose original lender was another institution.
– Other renegotiations of existing loans – loans provided earlier by the reporting bank and merely renegotiated (e.g. refixation of interest rates on loans for house purchase). Also includes consolidated loans whose original lender was either another institution/other institutions in addition to the reporting bank, or only the reporting bank. As in the case of refinanced loans, any increase in a loan forms part of the net new loans category.

New business is equal to outstanding amounts in the following types of categories: overnight deposits, deposits redeemable at notice, current account deposits and overdrafts. The source of the data is the interest rate statistics statements submitted by banks to the Czech National Bank.

Table 7-11 Number of active commercial banks
The data are taken from the JERRS information system (Regulated institutions and registered financial market entities lists). Banks are divided into group according to direct ownership.

Table 7-12 Balance of payments
The balance of payments records economic transactions with other countries (i.e. between residents and non-residents) during a certain period. The basic structure of the balance of payments, using the IMF Balance of Payments Manual (6th edition, 2009), consists of the current, capital and financial accounts including the change in reserve assets. The current account records flows of goods (exports and imports in the national concept according to BOP methodology) and services (exports and imports of processing, maintenance and repair services, transport services, travel services and other commercial and non-commercial services), primary income on capital, investment and labour (interest, dividends, reinvested earnings, wages and part of contributions and subsidies vis-à-vis the EU budget) and compensating items for real financial resources granted or obtained without countervalue (secondary income such as subsidies and contributions vis-à-vis the EU budget and other EU funds, pensions, foreign aid, contributions, etc.). The capital account comprises capital transfers relating to debt forgiveness, ownership rights to fixed assets, investment grants above all from the EU budget and other EU funds that are reported on the capital account, and transfers of non-produced non-financial tangible assets (e.g. purchase or sale of land by embassies) and intangible assets (patents, licences, copyrights, trading in emission allowances etc.). The financial account records transactions connected with the creation, liquidation and change of ownership of financial assets and liabilities of the government, the banking and corporate sectors and other entities vis-à-vis the rest of the world. It provides information on financial (capital) flows, broken down into direct investment (equity capital and reinvested earnings, debt securities), portfolio investment of an equity and debt nature, financial derivatives, other investment and reserve assets. Other investment is broken down by financial instrument used (equity and debt securities, currency in circulation and deposits, loans, insurance, pension and standardised guarantee schemes, trade credit and advances, other accounts receivable or payable and Special Drawing Rights), by maturity (long-term, short-term) and by sector (the CNB, commercial banks, government and other sectors). Reserve assets shows the foreign asset transactions of the central bank. These assets may be easily mobilised as a source of direct financing of a payments imbalance and of indirect regulation of such an imbalance through interventions on the foreign exchange market. Reserve assets are included in the financial account.

Errors and omissions are a correction item between the resulting balance on the current and capital accounts on the one hand and the balance on the financial account on the other hand. They represent the balance of unidentified flows in the current, capital and financial accounts.

The sources used for compiling the balance of payments include the national statistics of external trade in goods and services (CZSO), reporting data from banks and non-banks, information from administrative sources from central authorities and other institutions, and the CNB’s own calculations.

Tables 7-13 and 7-14 Foreign direct investment in the Czech Republic by country and activity

The reported data show the inflow (flow) of foreign direct investment into the Czech Republic in the given year. The presentation of data on foreign direct investment has changed due to the introduction of the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (in 2014). The results are broken down according to the asset/liability principle. The assets side shows credit relations with enterprises in the group of direct investment (a change in loans provided). The liability side contains deposits in equity capital including reinvested earnings and credit relations with enterprises in the group of direct investment (a change in loans accepted). The NET item shows the net inflow of foreign direct investment from non-residents into the Czech Republic (liabilities net of assets). The presentation of the inflow of foreign direct investment is broken down by territory (the country of the immediate investor) and economic activity (NACE Rev. 2).

Foreign direct investment means such cross-border investment that reflects the objective of obtaining a lasting interest in a direct investment enterprise in the Czech Republic by a non-resident (direct investor). The lasting interest implies the existence of a long-term relationship between the direct investor and the enterprise, and a significant degree of influence on the management of the enterprise.

The data on foreign direct investment are based on information and documents in the form of statistical statements of non-banks pursuant to Article 41(1)(c) of Act No. 6/1993 Coll., on the Czech National Bank, as subsequently amended. The content, form, time-limits and manner of compiling and submitting information are stipulated in Decree No. 235/2013 Coll. The main sources used are the quarterly statements on selected external assets and liabilities and annual statements of non-financial corporations on stocks of foreign direct investment in the Czech Republic. Additional sources of information include statements from banks, stock exchange information, the Commercial Bulletin and the press.

Table 7-15 International investment position

The international investment position provides a survey of the overall composition of the financial assets and liabilities of national economic agents (residents) vis-à-vis foreign countries (non-residents) as of a certain date. The structure of the investment position corresponds to that of the financial account; its assets and liabilities are broken down by instrument into direct investment (equity including reinvested earnings and debt instruments), portfolio investment (equity and debt), financial derivatives and other investment, which are broken down by financial instrument (equity and debt securities, currency in circulation and deposits, loans, insurance, pension and standardised guarantee schemes, trade credit and advances, other accounts receivable or payable and Special Drawing Rights), by maturity (long-term, short-term) and by basic institutional sector group. The asset side also includes the CNB's reserve assets. Reserve gold (as well as gold in possession of commercial banks) has been valued at market price since 2000. Liabilities arising from the allocation of Special Drawing Rights are provided separately on the liabilities side.

The net investment position (the difference between total assets and liabilities) represents the net relationship vis-à-vis foreign countries (creditor or debtor position). In addition to transactions undertaken in previous periods and recorded in the balance of payments, the stock of assets and liabilities recorded as of a certain date in the investment position reflects exchange rate, price and other effects.

The sources used for compiling the investment position are as follows: Direct investment – quarterly survey of non-financial corporations focusing on assets and liabilities and annual statements of non-financial corporations focusing on direct investment stocks in the Czech Republic and abroad. Portfolio investment – monthly statement of monetary and other financial institutions, quarterly survey of non-financial corporations focusing on assets, monthly statement of investment firms (client-account and own-account transactions), residents’ notifications of securities issues on foreign markets and information from the SKD (the Short-Term Bond System administered by the CNB). The received data are compared with information from the Central Securities Depository. Financial derivatives – monthly statement of external assets and liabilities of the banking sector (the CNB and other monetary financial institutions), quarterly statements of foreign assets and liabilities of the non-financial corporations, insurance companies and central government sectors and monthly statement of assets and liabilities of the pension funds sector. Other investment – monthly statement of external assets and liabilities of the banking sector (the CNB and other monetary financial institutions), quarterly survey of non-financial corporations focusing on assets and liabilities (trade credits), monthly statement of financial loans and accounts abroad of non-financial corporations and other financial institutions, monthly statement of government assets and liabilities, administrative sources. Reserve assets – CNB balance sheet.

Table 7-16 External debt of the Czech Republic
External debt constitutes the stock of financial liabilities (with fixed maturity date) of national economic agents (residents) vis-à-vis foreign countries (non-residents), i.e. the value of amounts drawn (by contractual agreement) and outstanding (owed) as of a certain date. It does not include equity investment, i.e. direct investment (equity capital including reinvested earnings) and portfolio investment (equity securities, other participating interests and derivatives). The sources used for compiling the external debt figures are the same as the data sources for the international investment position (see the methodology related to the table 7-15).

Table 7-17 Reserve assets
Reserve assets consist of short-term (liquid) foreign assets held by the Czech National Bank and denominated in convertible currencies (deposits with foreign banks, credit provided, securities, foreign exchange and gold, Special Drawing Rights and the reserves position with the IMF) which are available to finance and regulate a balance of payments disequilibrium. The CNB balance sheet serves as the basis for calculating the reserve assets.

Table 7-18 Nominal and real CZK effective exchange rate indices
The nominal effective exchange rate of the koruna (NEER) expressed as an index shows the appreciation (index above 100) or depreciation (index below 100) of the national currency towards the basket of selected currencies for a given period against the base period (2020). The most widespread method of weighted geometric average of nominal exchange rates was used, taking into account the weights of total exports and imports of the Czech Republic’s largest trading partners. These countries account for approximately 90% of the Czech Republic’s foreign trade. Apart from euro area countries, represented by a single weight and the EUR exchange rate, these countries are China, Poland, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Hungary, Russian Federation, United States of America, Switzerland, Korea, Republic of, Romania, Sweden, Japan and Denmark. The weights were calculated in two alternatives. Alternative I – used by the International Monetary Fund – comprises the entire trade turnover of the Czech Republic. Alternative II – used by the European Central Bank – comprises only four commodity groups (SITC groups 5–8) of the Czech Republic’s foreign trade. Data sources: CNB exchange rate list, CZSO publications on the Czech Republic’s foreign trade.

The real effective exchange rate of the koruna (REER) is one of the indicators of the country’s international competitiveness and is generally understood to mean various levels of relative prices or costs expressed in a certain currency. In this respect, REER values above 100 signify a downward trend in the country’s competitiveness relative to the base period, whereas an REER below 100 means rising competitiveness of the country relative to the base period (2020). Among the various methods used to calculate the REER, the weighted geometric average of the ratio of the nominal exchange rate index to the price differential is the most widely used, with the weights given by the shares of the nation’s largest trading partners in trade turnover. The real effective exchange rate of the koruna comprises the consumer prices and industrial producer prices of 12 countries outside the euro area plus all euro area countries. Euro area countries are treated as a single currency and cost area in the calculations. The number of euro area countries corresponds to the current situation. The structure of the countries and their weights are identical to those used to calculate the nominal effective exchange rate of the koruna. In the first alternative, the weights relate to the overall trade turnover, whereas in the second alternative the weights relate only to the turnover in SITC groups 5–8. Data sources: Price indices from ECB statistics, nominal exchange rate indices from CNB calculations.

Formula for calculating the real effective exchange rate:
REER = 100 * (Σ (Sit* / Pit*) * wi*)
where Sit* – basic index for the domestic currency vs. the currency of the i-th trading partner in period t
Pit* – ratio of the basic price index of the i-th trading partner in period t to the Czech basic price index in period t; the base year is the same as the base year used for calculating Sit*
wi* – normalized weights of the currency of the i-th trading partner

Metodické vysvětlivky
Cenové indexy jsou počítány jako indexy výběrové, tj. z cen zjištěných u vybraných reprezentantů (zboží a služeb) sledovaných v souboru vybraných zpravodajských jednotek. Individuální indexy cen reprezentantů jsou agregovány do souhrnných indexů skupin reprezentantů a poté do souhrnného indexu celého souboru všech reprezentantů. Agregace se provádí formou váženého aritmetického průměru individuálních indexů. Jako stálé váhy se používají strukturní ukazatele hodnoty (produkce, tržeb, obratu, nákupu, výdajů domácností apod.) jednotlivých reprezentantů nebo skupiny reprezentantů. Tyto strukturní ukazatele se stanovují z údajů základního („nultého“) období (např. roku 2015, 2020, 2021).

Cenové indexy (měsíční, čtvrtletní) jsou počítány z cen šetřených za vymezené období (za měsíc kolem středu měsíce, za čtvrtletí ve 2. měsíci čtvrtletí). Roční indexy jsou počítány jako aritmetický průměr (u cen zemědělských výrobců jako vážený průměr) indexů z jednotlivých měsíců (čtvrtletí) roku, vypočítaných k vybranému cenovému základu, který se po určité období považuje za stálý základ.

Jednotlivé cenové indexy výrobců používají Klasifikaci produkce (CZ-CPA), která navazuje na Klasifikaci ekonomických činností (CZ-NACE). Pro cenové indexy stavební výroby je používána Klasifikace stavebních děl CZ-CC. U spotřebitelských cen byla zavedena platná Evropská klasifikace individuální spotřeby podle účelu (ECOICOP) – viz www.csu.gov.cz/evropska-klasifikace-individualni-spotreby-podle-ucelu-ecoicop. Indexy cen vývozu a dovozu jsou konstruovány podle Harmonizovaného systému popisu a číselného označování zboží (mezinárodní klasifikace popisu a označování zboží) a dále jsou přepočteny v členění podle Standardní klasifikace mezinárodního obchodu OSN (Standard International Trade Classification – SITC Rev. 4).

Poznámky k tabulkám
Tab. 8-1 Indexy cen výrobců a indexy spotřebitelských cen
Index cen zemědělských výrobců
Ceny zemědělských výrobců jsou měsíčně zjišťovány prostřednictvím statistického výkazu o cenách zemědělských výrobků u cca 500 vybraných výrobců v zemědělství (u družstevních, soukromých a státních organizací). Ceny jsou očištěny od daně z přidané hodnoty. Zjišťovány jsou realizační smluvní ceny (bez vlastní spotřeby) určené pro tuzemský i zahraniční trh bez dopravních nákladů spojených s přepravou k odběrateli.

V průběhu roku 2022 byl index cen zemědělských výrobců podroben standardní komplexní revizi. Cenové indexy zemědělských výrobců jsou od ledna 2023 počítány na váhových schématech odvozených od průměru tržeb za roky 2019, 2020 a 2021. Cenovým základem indexů je průměr roku 2020.

Váhové podíly zemědělských sezónních a nesezónních komodit se v různých měsících roku od sebe navzájem liší, proto bylo ve výpočtu indexu použito dvourozměrného váhového schématu ve tvaru matice. Jeden rozměr je určen pro vertikální agregaci od úrovně reprezentantů až po nejvyšší úroveň, druhý rozměr je určen pro 12 měsíců v roce. Nominálnímu součtu 1 000 je pak roven součet vah nejvyšší agregace za každý měsíc v roce. Pro výpočet indexu cen zemědělských výrobců se využívá proměnlivých měsíčních vah.

Index cen výrobků a služeb vstupujících do zemědělství
Index cen výrobků a služeb vstupujících do zemědělství je počítán v souladu s metodikou Eurostatu. Tento způsob výpočtu je založen na kombinovaném indexu cen, který je složen z indexu cen „Výrobků a služeb běžně spotřebovávaných v zemědělství“ a indexu cen „Výrobků a služeb přispívajících do zemědělských investic“. Za cenový základ byl použit průměr roku 2015, váhové schéma odpovídá struktuře nákladů v zemědělství v tomtéž roce.

Index cen v lesnictví (surové dříví) – pouze vlastníci lesa
Index cen surového dříví je počítán čtvrtletně z průměrných realizačních (smluvních) cen bez DPH, dosažených v jednotlivých čtvrtletích šetřeného roku. Vykázané realizační ceny jsou za dodávky surového dříví pro tuzemsko (bez vlastní spotřeby a exportu).

V rámci mimořádné revize indexu cen lesnictví – vlastníci v roce 2011 byl zaveden vážený průměr pro výpočet průměrných cen u čtyř nejvýznamnějších sortimentů (výřezy III. A/B jakosti – smrk, výřezy III. C jakosti – smrk, výřezy III. D jakosti – smrk, dříví V. jakosti – dříví pro výrobu buničiny – smrk). Průměrné ceny ostatních sortimentů jsou nadále počítány prostým aritmetickým průměrem. Pro výpočet indexu se používá 16 jehličnatých a 11 listnatých sortimentů.

V průběhu roku 2016 proběhla standardní komplexní revize výpočtu indexů cen surového dříví. Indexním a cenovým základem je 4. čtvrtletí roku 2016. V rámci revize bylo stanoveno nové váhové schéma sortimentů dle vykázaného přehledu ročních tržeb respondenty na samostatném výkazu za roky 2013, 2014 a 2015. Cenové indexy podle nové struktury se publikují od 1. čtvrtletí roku 2017. Od roku 2020 byla zúžena struktura publikovaných čtvrtletních indexů.

Index cen průmyslových výrobců
Ceny průmyslových výrobců jsou zjišťovány měsíčně na základě údajů z vybraných organizací (cca 1 200) za vybrané reprezentanty (cca 5 000). Vykazované ceny jsou ceny sjednané mezi dodavatelem a odběratelem v tuzemsku bez DPH a spotřební daně (bez nákladů na dopravu k zákazníkovi a nákladů s ní spojených) fakturované za významnější obchodní případy. Období zahrnuje ceny mezi 1. až 20. kalendářním dnem sledovaného měsíce. Z vykázaných cen se na stálých vahách počítá index cen průmyslových výrobců. Ten měří průměrný cenový vývoj všech průmyslových výrobků vyrobených a prodaných na domácím, českém trhu. Za průmyslové výrobky se považují výrobky vyrobené v sekcích B až E podle CZ-NACE.

V roce 2022 proběhla standardní komplexní revize indexů cen průmyslových výrobců. Na jejím základě jsou cenové indexy od ledna 2023 počítány na vahách za rok 2021. Váhy byly stanoveny na základě struktury tuzemských tržeb průmyslových výrobců za rok 2021. Cenové indexy vypočítávané k základu prosinec 2015 = 100 jsou nahrazeny indexy s novým cenovým základem prosinec 2021 = 100. Takto vypočtené indexy jsou od čtyřmístné úrovně CZ-CPA (a výše) váhového schématu řetězeny k indexům o základu průměr roku 2015 = 100, čímž je zajištěno pokračování dosavadní časové řady. Z časové řady se základem průměr 2015 = 100 je spočtena časová řada se základem průměr 2021 = 100. Výpočet časových řad k základům průměr roku 2005 = 100 a průměr roku 2010 = 100 byl v prosinci 2022 ukončen. Informace o revizi indexů cen průmyslových výrobců jsou uvedeny na internetových stránkách: www.csu.gov.cz/revize_ceny_vyrobcu.

Index cen stavebních děl
Indexy cen stavebních děl jsou počítány čtvrtletně z indexů cen stavebních prací, jejichž výpočet je založen na základě cen vykazovaných ve statistických výkazech. V roce 2022 byla provedena mimořádná revize cenových indexů stavební výroby. Od roku 2023 jsou publikovány cenové indexy počítané na základě indexních schémat, které vycházejí z průměrné produkční struktury stavební výroby v letech 2017 až 2021. Základním obdobím publikované časové řady je rok 2015 a základní cenovou hladinou je průměr za rok 2015. Použitím metody řetězení nejsou publikované časové řady cenových indexů nadále agregovatelné pomocí vah. Čtvrtletní statistický výkaz Ceny Stav 1-04 obsahuje 136 cenových reprezentantů. Zpravodajská síť je stanovena záměrným výběrem cca 600 respondentů všech velikostních kategorií a různých právních forem, doplněných některými specializovanými montážními podniky se zaměřením na montáže vzduchotechniky, výtahů a ocelových konstrukcí (oddíly CZ-NACE 25, 28, 33, 41, 42, 43, 80). Čtvrtletně vykazované ceny (realizované v prostředním měsíci čtvrtletí; na území ČR) jsou cenami dohodnutými mezi dodavatelem a odběratelem za jednotku stavební práce, realizované vlastními zaměstnanci firmy, pracujícími majiteli firmy, osobami pracujícími na dohody a spolupracujícími osobami samostatně výdělečně činnými. Ceny obsahují, kromě materiálu nutného pro provedení práce, i veškeré další náklady nutné k realizaci sledované činnosti, bez nákladů na zařízení staveniště a daně z přidané hodnoty.

Index nákladů stavební výroby
Index nákladů stavební výroby je počítán čtvrtletně a patří do skupiny sekundárních statistik bez vlastního výkaznictví. Ve čtvrtletním výpočtu je zohledněn cenový vývoj přímých a nepřímých nákladů stavebních prací. Z přímých nákladů to jsou zejména ceny materiálů, strojů a energií, jejichž vývoj je přebírán ze statistiky cen průmyslových výrobců. Zdrojem informací o mzdových nákladech jsou šetření mezd v produkční a cenové statistice stavebnictví. K přímým nákladům patří i náklady dopravní, jejichž vývoj sleduje statistika cen tržních služeb. Nepřímé náklady představují režie výrobní a správní. Jejich pohyb je odvozován z cenových a produkčních ukazatelů stavebnictví.

Index cen poskytovatelů tržních služeb
Index cen poskytovatelů tržních služeb je ukazatelem ekonomického cyklu, kterým se měří změna obchodních cen poskytovatelů řady služeb, jež jsou dodávány v rámci mezispotřeby. Slouží pro sledování cenových pohybů a měření inflačních tlaků na trhu služeb. Cílem indexu je změřit průměrnou měsíční změnu v cenách vybraných tržních služeb určených převážně pro podnikatelskou sféru na tuzemském trhu. Sledovanými cenami jsou realizační smluvní ceny, popř. katalogové, které jsou očištěny od daně z přidané hodnoty. Úhrnný index cen poskytovatelů tržních služeb je složen z dílčích indexů cen vybraných služeb v členění dle CZ-CPA v oddílech: 49, 50, 52, 53, 58, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 68, 69, 70, 71, 73, 74, 77, 78, 80, 81, 82. Jedná se o indexy cen poskytovatelů následujících tržních služeb: pozemní a potrubní doprava, vodní doprava, skladování a podpůrné služby v dopravě, poštovní a kurýrní služby, vydavatelské služby, telekomunikační služby, programování a poradenství, informační služby, finanční služby, pojištění, služby v oblasti nemovitostí, právní a účetnické služby, vedení podniků, poradenství v oblasti řízení, architektonické a inženýrské služby, reklamní služby a průzkum trhu, ostatní odborné, vědecké a technické služby, služby v oblasti pronájmu, služby v oblasti zaměstnání, bezpečnostní a pátrací služby, služby související se stavbami, úpravou krajiny, administrativní a jiné podpůrné služby.

Od ledna 2018 jsou bazické (základní) indexy cen tržních služeb počítány k novému indexnímu základu průměr roku 2015 = 100 na nových vahách, založených na struktuře tržeb roku 2015. Časová řada bazických indexů se základem průměr roku 2005 = 100 byla k prosinci 2017 ukončena a nahrazena časovou řadou se základem průměr roku 2015 = 100. Dosud publikované indexy nebyly revidovány.

Index cen vývozu a dovozu
Indexy cen vývozu a dovozu jsou počítány za Českou republiku od roku 1993. Ve váhových schématech pro vývoz a dovoz je nyní celkem zařazeno více než 5000 výrobků, surovin a materiálů - cenových reprezentantů, které se významně podílejí na hodnotě realizace jednotlivých významnějších skupin zahraničního obchodu (vývozu i dovozu). Cenovým základem indexů jsou průměrné ceny roku 2015. V roce 2017 proběhla standardní revize výpočtu indexů cen zahraničního obchodu. Počínaje cenovými indexy za referenční období leden 2018 jsou cenové indexy vývozu a dovozu počítány na novém váhovém schématu, na struktuře zahraničního obchodu se zbožím roku 2015, k cenovému základu průměr roku 2015 = 100. Dosavadní časová řada indexů se základem průměr roku 2005 = 100 byla přepočtena na indexní základ průměr roku 2015 = 100. Nově vypočtené indexy jsou od ledna 2018 řetězeny na tuto časovou řadu indexů, čímž je zajištěno její pokračování. Řetězícím obdobím je prosinec 2017. Výběr cenových reprezentantů provedly tuzemské ekonomické subjekty, které mají významný podíl na zahraničním obchodě České republiky - jednak výrobní podniky, ale i podniky zabývající se pouze zahraničně obchodní činností, a to cca 600 ekonomických subjektů pro vývoz a rovněž cca 600 ekonomických subjektů pro dovoz. Při vývozu se sledují ceny franko hranice ČR, při dovozu ceny fakturované zahraničním dodavatelem. Pokud se s cenovým reprezentantem obchoduje v několika zemích, uvádějí zpravodajské jednotky průměrné ceny jako vážený aritmetický průměr z cen docilovaných při významnějších obchodních transakcích (vážených množstvím výrobků ve fyzických jednotkách). Ceny jsou přepočteny na Kč příslušným průměrným měsíčním měnovým kurzem ČNB a sledují se bez cla a daně z přidané hodnoty a spotřební daně.

Index spotřebitelských cen zboží a služeb
Vývoj spotřebitelských cen se sleduje na spotřebních koších založených na souboru vybraných druhů zboží a služeb placených obyvatelstvem. Podrobné spotřební koše jsou popsány v dokumentu „Indexy spotřebitelských cen – revize2020“ umístěném na webových stránkách ČSÚ: www.csu.gov.cz/indexy_spotrebitelskych_cen_revize. Podrobnější informace k metodice indexů spotřebitelských cen je možné najít zde: www.csu.gov.cz/kdyz_se_rekne_inflace_resp_mira_inflace. Spotřební koš obsahuje cca 450 konkrétních výrobků a služeb (reprezentantů) podle ECOICOP, která vychází z mezinárodní klasifikace COICOP. Váhy základního období pro výpočet skupinových a úhrnných indexů vycházejí ze struktury výdajů domácností podle výsledků statistiky národních účtů v letech 2019–2021. Váhy pro detailní cenové reprezentanty jsou zaktualizovány dle údajů statistiky rodinných účtů doplněných o další dostupné zdroje a šetření. Cenami základního období jsou průměrné ceny z prosince 2021. Od roku 2017 je indexním základem rok 2015. Spotřebitelské ceny jsou šetřeny měsíčně ve vybrané zpravodajské síti prodejen a provozoven (cca 8 500) ve vybraných okresech České republiky a v hl. m. Praze pracovníky Českého statistického úřadu. U vybraných reprezentantů z oddílů klasifikace ECOICOP (01 potraviny a nealkoholické nápoje, 02 alkoholické nápoje, tabák, 05 bytové vybavení, zařízení domácností; opravy, 06 zdraví, 09 rekreace a kultura, 12 ostatní zboží a služby) jsou ceny z místního cenového zjišťování plně nebo částečně nahrazeny cenami, jež vychází ze „scanner” dat (dat z pokladen maloobchodních řetězců). Jedná se o celorepublikové jednotkové ceny vybraných produktů u sledovaných řetězců.

Tab. 8-2 Indexy cen vybraných druhů nemovitostí
Data v této tabulce vycházejí z nové publikace „Ceny nemovitostí“, která volně navazuje na již zrušenou publikaci „Ceny sledovaných druhů nemovitostí“, která vyšla naposledy koncem roku 2020 s daty za roky 2017–2019. ČSÚ v letech 2000 až 2020 vydával „Ceny sledovaných druhů nemovitostí“. Data byla založena výlučně na údajích pořizovaných finančními úřady a obsažených v daňových přiznáních o cenách zjištěných při oceňování nemovitostí a o cenách sjednaných za tyto nemovitosti v případě prodeje. Pořizování se opíralo o zákon č. 151/1997 Sb., o oceňování majetku. Ke dni 26. září 2020 však došlo ke zrušení daně z nabytí nemovitých věcí, a to se zpětnou účinností pro případy, kdy byl vklad práva do katastru nemovitostí proveden v prosinci 2019 a později. V důsledku toho zcela zaniknul stávající datový zdroj. Publikace proto skončila posledním referenčním rokem 2019. Pro zajištění alespoň částečné návaznosti původních statistik se ČSÚ pokusil využít jakožto alternativní zdroj údaje z katastru nemovitostí, kterými disponuje Český úřad zeměměřický a katastrální (ČÚZK). Primární nezpracovaná data jsou sice prakticky vyčerpávající, avšak chybí mnohé cenotvorné informace, které do dosavadních dat vkládali odhadci při individuálním posouzení charakteristik dané nemovitosti. Pro účely dalšího zpracování je dále potřeba data doplnit o související údaje z Registru sčítacích obvodů a budov spravovaného ČSÚ (RSO) a z Registru územní identifikace, adres a nemovitostí spravovaného ČÚZK (RÚIAN). Vzhledem k jisté nekonzistenci RSO a původního zdroje (katastr nemovitostí) není možno propojit všechna data a původní zdroj tak ztrácí do jisté míry charakteristiku vyčerpávajícího souboru.

Účelem vytvářeného systému v nové publikaci „Ceny nemovitostí“ je poskytování informací o rozložení cenové hladiny bytů a rodinných domů, jakož i vývoj tohoto rozložení v čase. Avšak podobně jako tomu bylo u předchozí publikace, účelem nové publikace není vytvářet detailní cenové mapy. Na rozdíl od předchozího zdroje nemá nyní ČSÚ spolehlivé zdroje k vytváření cenových statistik stavebních pozemků a bytových domů.

Cenové indexy, které pokrývají období 2015–2022, jsou spočteny na srovnatelných datech nového zdroje. V období, kde se cenový index časově překrývá mezi původní a novou publikací, je vhodnější užití tohoto nového zdroje.

Tab. 8-3 Vybrané indexy cen průmyslových výrobců
V členění podle CZ-CPA jsou uvedeny vybrané skupiny vymezené třetí úrovní CZ-CPA, v některých případech oddíly vymezené druhou úrovní CZ-CPA.

Tab. 8-4 Vybrané indexy cen tržních služeb
V členění podle CZ-CPA jsou uvedeny vybrané položky vymezené třetí úrovní CZ-CPA (skupiny), v některých případech detailnějším stupněm třídění (třídy, kategorie, subkategorie).

Tab. 8-5 Ceny vybraných druhů zemědělských výrobků
Současný systém statistického zjišťování platí od roku 1991. Ceny se sledují v síti vybraných zemědělských výrobců. Jsou to převážně nominální ceny vybraných zemědělských výrobků podle hlavních (specifikovaných) jakostí. Ceny zeleniny a ovoce jsou zjišťovány pouze za I. jakost. Vykázaná cena je prostým aritmetickým průměrem z cen jednotlivých významných kontraktů, které byly realizovány v období kolem středu sledovaného měsíce.

Tab. 8-6 Ceny vybraných sortimentů surového dříví (pouze vlastníci lesa)
Jsou uváděny průměrné ceny vybraných výrobků (sortimentů) surového dříví z čtvrtletního cenového zjišťování. Ceny jsou do konce roku 2010 počítány prostým aritmetickým průměrem z cen jednotlivých obchodních případů, realizovaných za celé období sledovaného čtvrtletí. Od roku 2011 došlo k zavedení váženého průměru u výřezů III. A/B jakosti – smrk a dříví V. jakosti – smrk. Průměrné ceny ostatních uvedených sortimentů jsou nadále počítány prostým aritmetickým průměrem. Publikované časové řady před rokem 2011 nejsou plně srovnatelné.

Tab. 8-7 Spotřebitelské ceny vybraných druhů zboží a služeb
Spotřebitelské ceny vybraných cenových reprezentantů jsou průměrné spotřebitelské ceny za Českou republiku v prosinci každého roku, které mají charakter průměrných hodnot jednotlivých variet příslušného reprezentantu. Jejich uspořádání v tabulce vychází ze struktury spotřebního koše platného od roku 2022.

Tab. 8-10 Harmonizované indexy spotřebitelských cen
Harmonizované indexy spotřebitelských cen (Harmonised indices of consumer prices – HICPs) v Evropské unii vznikly jako reakce na potřebu vytvořit srovnatelné indexy spotřebitelských cen, aby bylo možné změřit trendy inflace členských států EU jako kritérium přistoupení k Evropské měnové unii. Mezi strukturou spotřebního koše národního indexu spotřebitelských cen České republiky a strukturou spotřebního koše HICP jsou určité rozdíly. Ve váhách HICP jsou zahrnuty tržby za nákupy cizinců na území České republiky, ale není v nich zahrnuto imputované nájemné na rozdíl od národního indexu spotřebitelských cen, kde tržby za nákupy cizinců zahrnuty nejsou, ale je zde zahrnuto imputované nájemné.

Harmonizovaný index spotřebitelských cen užívá řetězových vah, které jsou obměňovány každoročně v prosinci. Zdrojem aktualizace jsou data národních účtů (konečná peněžní spotřeba domácností). Cenovým základem indexu je průměr roku 2015.

Indexy jsou uvedeny v rozsahu 12 oddílů klasifikace ECOICOP.

Methodological notes
The price indices are calculated as sample indices, i.e. the calculation thereof is based on prices of selected representatives (of goods and services) monitored in a sample of reporting units. The individual price indices for the representatives are aggregated into aggregate indices for groups of representatives and then further into an aggregate index for the whole set of all the representatives. The aggregation is carried out by means of a weighted arithmetic mean of individual indices. Structural indicators of value (production, sales, turnover, purchases, household expenditure, etc.) of respective representatives or a group of representatives are used as constant weights in the calculation. These structural indicators are determined from data of the base (“zero”) reference period (e.g. years 2015, 2020, 2021).

Price indices (monthly and quarterly ones) are calculated from prices measured in the reference period (around the middle of a month for monthly indices, in the 2nd month of a quarter for quarterly indices). Annual indices are calculated as an arithmetic mean of the indices (in the case of agricultural producer prices as a weighted average) for individual months/quarters of the year, related to a selected price base, which is considered to be a constant base for a certain period of time.

The individual producer price indices use the national version called the Classification of Products (CZ-CPA) of the Statistical Classification of Products by Activity in the European Union, Version 2.1 (CPA Ver. 2.1), which is linked to the national version Classification of Economic Activities (CZ-NACE) of the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community, Rev. 2 (NACE Rev. 2). The national version of the international Classification of Types of Constructions CZ-CC is used for price indices of construction production. Consumer price indices are derived on the basis of the European Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (ECOICOP) – see www.ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/metadata/classifications. Export and import price indices are constructed according to the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System (a system for classifying goods in international trade) and are further recalculated to comply with the breakdown of the Standard International Trade Classification, Rev. 4 (SITC, Rev. 4).

Notes on Tables
Table 8-1 Annual averages of producer and consumer price indices
Agricultural producer price index
Agricultural producer prices are measured monthly by means of the statistical questionnaire on agricultural producer prices at approximately 500 selected agricultural producers (cooperatives, private farms, and state organisations). Prices are adjusted to be free of VAT. The survey measures trade contractual prices (excluding own consumption) for the domestic market as well as foreign markets, excluding freight costs related to the transport to the purchaser.

In the course of 2022, the agricultural producer price index underwent a standard comprehensive revision. Since January 2023, the agricultural producer price indices have been calculated based on weighting schemes derived from the average revenues in 2019, 2020, and 2021. The price base applied is the average of the year 2020.

Weights of seasonal and non-seasonal agricultural commodities differ in various months of the year and therefore the index calculation employed a two-dimensional weighting scheme as a matrix. One dimension is for vertical aggregation from the level of representatives upward to the highest level. The second dimension is for twelve months of the year. Then the sum of weights of the highest aggregation for each month of the year is equal to the nominal sum of 1000. Variable monthly weights are used for the calculation of agricultural producer price indices.

Agricultural input price index
The agricultural input price index (AIPI) for goods and services is calculated in compliance with the Eurostat methodology. This method of calculation is based on a combined price index, comprising of price indices of “Goods and services consumed in agriculture” and of “Goods and services contributing to agricultural investments”. The price base applied is the average of the year 2015; the weighting scheme corresponds to the structure of agricultural costs in the same year.

Forestry (roundwood) price index – only forest owners
The roundwood price index, can be also found as the raw timber price index, is calculated quarterly from average strike (contractual) prices, excluding VAT, reached in individual quarters of the surveyed year. Reported strike prices are for deliveries of roundwood (raw timber) for the domestic market (excluding own consumption and exports).

In 2011, within an occasional revision of the forestry (roundwood) price index – owners, a weighted average for the calculation of average prices was introduced for four most important assortments of roundwood (logs, quality III A/B – spruce; logs, quality III C – spruce; logs, quality III D – spruce; timber, quality V – timber for the pulp production – spruce). Average prices of other sorts are still calculated as a simple arithmetic mean. The index is calculated of 16 coniferous sorts and 11 non-coniferous sorts.

In the course of the year 2016, a standard comprehensive revision of the calculation methodology of roundwood price indices was carried out. The index base and price base applied is the 4th quarter of 2016.

Prices
was set for the assortments of roundwood according to the respondents-reported overview of the annual revenues on the separate questionnaires for 2013, 2014, and 2015. Price indices according to the new structure have been published since the 1st quarter of 2017. The structure of published quarterly indices has been narrowed since 2020.

Industrial producer price index
Industrial producer prices are surveyed monthly based on the data from selected organisations (approximately 1 200) on selected representatives (approximately 5 000). Reported prices are prices agreed upon between a supplier and a customer residing in the Czech Republic (excluding VAT, excise duty, costs of transport to the customer, and the transport-related costs) and invoiced for rather important business deals. The prices are measured between the 1st and the 20th calendar day of the reference month.

The industrial producer price index is calculated from reported prices applying constant weights. The index measures the average price development of all industrial products manufactured and sold on the domestic market in the Czech Republic. Industrial products are products manufactured by activities classified under the CZ-NACE sections B to E.

In 2022, a standard comprehensive revision of industrial producer price indices was carried out. From January 2023, on the basis thereof, price indices have been calculated applying weights for the year 2021. The weights were set based on the structure of domestic sales (revenues) of industrial producers for the year 2021.

Price indices calculated with the base of December 2015 = 100 have been replaced by indices with a new price base of December 2021 = 100. The indices calculated in this way are chained from the four-digit CZ-CPA level (and above) of the weighting scheme to indices based on the year 2015 average = 100, by which the continuation of the existing time series is ensured. From the time series with a base of average of 2015 = 100, a time series with a base of average of 2021 = 100 is calculated. Calculation of time series to bases of average of 2005 = 100 and 2010 average = 100 was discontinued in December 2022.

Information on the revision of the industrial producer price indices can be found on the website of the Czech Statistical Office at: www.csu.gov.cz/revisions_producer_prices.

Price index of constructions
Price indices of constructions are calculated quarterly from price indices of construction works calculated from prices reported in statistical questionnaires (reports). In 2022, an occasional revision of price indices of construction production was carried out. Since 2023, price indices have been published that are calculated on the basis of index schemes, which are based on the average production structure of the construction production from 2017 to 2021. The year 2015 is the base period of the time series published and the average for 2015 is the base price level. Because of the applied chaining method, published time series of price indices cannot be aggregated by means of weights anymore.

The quarterly statistical questionnaire (“Ceny Stav 1-04”) includes 136 price representatives. The network of reporting units is established by purposive sampling of about 600 respondents of all size classes and different legal forms, plus some enterprises specialising in assembly of air conditioning, lifts, and steel structures (CZ-NACE divisions 25, 28, 33, 41, 42, 43, and 80). The quarterly reported prices (implemented in the second month of the given quarter in the territory of the Czech Republic) are prices agreed between the supplier and the customer for a unit of construction works carried out by own staff of the reporting unit, working owners of enterprises, persons working under various contracts for work (an agreement on work performance and an agreement on work activity), and collaborating self-employed persons without employees. In addition to material necessary for the work being performed, they include all other costs needed to perform the activities under survey, excluding costs of site equipment and VAT.

Construction cost index
The construction cost index is calculated quarterly and falls into the group of secondary statistics, which do not have their own questionnaire-based survey. The quarterly calculation reflects the price development in direct and indirect costs of construction works. The direct costs include, first of all, prices of materials, machinery, and energies, development of which is taken from the industrial producer price statistics. The survey of wages and salaries in the construction production and price statistics is the source of information on wage expenses (labour costs). The direct costs also include transport costs, development of which is monitored by the market services price statistics. The indirect costs are production and administration overhead costs. Their development is derived from price indicators and production indicators in construction.

Services producer price index
The services producer price index (SPPI) is a business-cycle indicator measuring the change in trading prices of providers of a number of services that are supplied for intermediate consumption. It serves for monitoring of price movements and for measuring of inflation pressure on the services market. The index objective is to measure the average monthly changes in prices of selected market services dedicated mostly to the business sphere on the domestic market. The prices monitored are the contractual prices or catalogue prices adjusted to be free of VAT.

The aggregate services producer price index comprises partial price indices of selected services by the Classification of Products by Activity (CZ-CPA) in the following divisions 49, 50, 52, 53, 58, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 68, 69, 70, 71, 73, 74, 77, 78, 80, 81, 82. They are price indices of providers of the following market services: land transport services and transport services via pipelines, water transport services, warehousing and support services for transportation, postal and courier services, publishing services, telecommunications services, computer programming, consultancy and related services, information services, financial services, except insurance and pension funding, insurance, reinsurance and pension funding services, except compulsory social security, real estate services, legal and accounting services, services of head offices; management consulting services, architectural and engineering services; technical testing and analysis services, advertising and market research services, other professional, scientific, and technical services, rental and leasing services, employment services, security and investigation services, services to buildings and landscape, office administrative, office support and other business support services.
Since January 2018, base indices of market services prices have been calculated with a new index base, i.e. the average for 2015 = 100 and using new weights based on the sales structure in 2015. The time series of base indices with the price base of the average for 2005 = 100 was terminated as at December 2017 and replaced by the time series with the price base of the average for 2015 = 100. The indices, that have been published so far, were not revised.
Export and import price indices
These indices have been compiled for the Czech Republic since 1993. Weighting schemes for exports and imports now include over 5000 products, raw materials, and materials – price representatives – in total; they contribute in an important way to the value of trade in rather significant groups of commodities traded in international trade, both exports and imports.
Average prices for 2015 are the price base of the indices. In 2017, a standard revision of the calculation of international trade price indices was carried out. Since the reference period of January 2018, export and import price indices have been calculated using a new weighting scheme based upon international trade in goods (change of ownership) structure of 2015 and with the price base of the average of 2015 = 100.
The existing time series of the indices based on the average for 2005 = 100 was recalculated to the price base of the average of 2015 = 100. Since January 2018, the newly calculated indices have been chained to the aforementioned time series of the indices in order to provide for continuation of the time series. The chaining period is December 2017.
Price representatives were selected by domestic businesses (economic entities), which significantly participate in international trade in goods (change of ownership) of the Czech Republic; they were both production enterprises and also businesses only engaged in international trade activities, namely about 600 economic entities for exports and also approximately 600 economic entities for imports. For exports, the prices measured are FOB prices at borders of the Czech Republic and for imports, these are the prices invoiced by external suppliers. If a price representative is traded in several countries, the reporting units give average prices as a weighted arithmetic mean of prices obtained in significant commercial transactions (weighted by the quantity of products in physical units). The prices are converted into CZK by means of the relevant average monthly exchange rate of the Czech National Bank and are measured free of customs duty, VAT, and excise duty.
Consumer price index of goods and services
Trends in consumer prices are measured on consumer baskets based on a set of selected kinds of goods and services paid for by the population. Consumer baskets are described in detail in the document “Consumer price indices – 2020 revision,” which is available on the website of the Czech Statistical Office at: www.csu.gov.cz/indexy_spotrebitelskych_cen_revize (Czech only).
For more detailed information on the consumer price indices methodology see: Inflation, Inflation Rate - Methodology
The consumer basket includes about 450 specific products and services (representatives) according to the European Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (ECOICOP) based on the international Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP). The base reference period weights for the calculation of group and aggregate indices are derived from the structure of household expenditure according to the results of national accounts statistics in 2019–2021.
Weights for detailed price representatives have been updated according to data of household budget statistics, to which other available sources and surveys were added.
The average prices from December 2021 are prices of the base period. Since 2017, the year 2015 has been the base for the price index.
Consumer prices are measured once a month by employees of the Czech Statistical Office in a network of selected reporting stores and other outlets (about 8500) in selected Districts (LAU 1) of the Czech Republic and in the Capital City of Prague.
At selected representatives from divisions of the ECOICOP classification (01 Food and non-alcoholic beverages, 02 Alcoholic beverages, tobacco and narcotics, 05 Furnishings, household equipment and routine household maintenance, 06 Health, 09 Recreation and culture, and 12 Miscellaneous goods and services), prices from local price survey have been fully or partially replaced by prices from scanner data (data from cash registers of retail chains). It applies to nationwide unit prices of selected products at monitored retail chains.

Table 8-2 Price indices of selected types of real estate
Data in this table are based on a new publication “Real estate prices” (Ceny nemovitostí) (Czech only), which follows from an already cancelled publication “Prices of observed types of real estate” (Ceny sledovaných typů nemovitostí), which was published for the last time at the end of 2020 with data for the years 2017–2019.

From 2000 to 2020, the CZSO published “Prices of observed types of real estate” (Ceny sledovaných typů nemovitostí). The data were based exclusively on data acquired by financial authorities and contained in tax returns on prices found out when assessing real estate and on prices agreed for those real estates in case of sale. The acquisition was backed by the Act No 151/1997 Sb, on Valuation of Property (Zákon č. 151/1997 Sb., o oceňování majetku).

As at 26 September 2020, however, the tax on real estate acquisition was abolished, namely with retroactive effect for the cases, in which the title registration was made in December 2019 or later. As a result of that, the existing data source absolutely ceased to exist and therefore the publication ended with the last reference year of 2019.

In order to ensure at least partial continuity of original statistics, the CZSO tried to use as an alternative source data from the Cadastre of Real Estate (Katastr nemovitostí) that are available at the Czech Office for Surveying, Mapping and Cadastre (ČÚZK). Primary unprocessed data are virtually exhaustive; however, a lot of price-forming information is missing that was put in the existing data by real estate assessors when individually assessing characteristics of a given real estate. Moreover, for the purposes of further processing, it is necessary to add the following to the data: related data from the Register of Census Districts and Buildings (RSO) kept by the CZSO and from the Registry of Territorial Identification, Addresses and Real Estate (RÚIAN) maintained by the ČÚZK. Since the RSO and the original source (the Cadastre of Real Estate) are somewhat inconsistent, it is not possible to interlink all data and the original source thus loses, to some extent, the feature of an exhaustive set.

It is the aim of the system being created in the new publication “Real estate prices” (Ceny nemovitostí) (Czech only) to provide information on the distribution of the price level of dwellings (flats) and family houses as well as development of this distribution in time. However, similarly as for the previous publication, it is not an objective of the new publication to create detailed price maps. Unlike the previous source, the CZSO now does not have reliable sources to create price statistics of building plots and multi-dwelling buildings.

Price indices, which cover the 2015–2022 period are calculated using comparable data of the new source. In a period, in which the price index overlaps (as for time) between the original publication and the new one it is more appropriate to use this new source.

Table 8-3 Selected industrial producer price indices
The table presents selected groups as defined by the third level of the CZ-CPA; in some cases, divisions defined by the second level of the CZ-CPA are shown.

Selected items of the third level of the CZ-CPA (groups) are given here, and in certain cases items in even more detailed classification (classes, categories, and sub-categories) are shown.

Table 8-5 Prices of selected agricultural products
The current system of statistical surveying has been in use since 1991. The prices are measured in the network of selected agricultural producers. They are mostly nominal prices of selected agricultural products by main (specified) quality grade. Prices of vegetables and fruit refer to top quality only. The reported price is a simple arithmetic mean of prices of individual significant contracts, which were implemented around the middle of the reference month.

Table 8-6 Roundwood prices of selected assortments (only for forest owners)
Average prices of selected roundwood products (assortments) derived from figures reported in quarterly price surveys are shown. Until the end of 2010, the prices were calculated as a simple arithmetic mean of prices of individual business cases (transactions) implemented in the whole period of the reference quarter. In 2011, a weighting average was introduced for logs, quality III A/B – spruce and timber, quality V – spruce. Average prices of other assortments mentioned are still calculated as a simple arithmetic mean. The time series published before 2011 are not fully comparable.

Table 8-7 Consumer prices of selected types of goods and services
Consumer prices of selected price representatives are average consumer prices for the Czech Republic in December of each year, which are, in nature, average values of individual varieties of the representative concerned. Their arrangement in the table is based on the consumer basket structure valid since 2022.

In the consumer price indices table for goods and services (Tabulka 8-8) the group indices of consumer prices are arranged to comply with level 3 of the ECOICOP classification.
In the consumer price indices table for goods and services for the total population of households and for households of pensioners in 2022 (Tabulka 8-9), the consumer price indices refer to the 12 divisions of the ECOICOP classification for the total population of households and for households of pensioners.
In the harmonised indices of consumer prices table (Tabulka 8-10), harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICPs) were formed in the EU in response to the need to establish comparable indices of consumer prices so that inflation trends in the EU Member States can be measured to be used as a criterion for the accession to the European Monetary Union.
In the harmonised indices of consumer prices table, there are certain differences between the structure of the consumer basket for the national index of consumer prices of the Czech Republic and the structure of the consumer basket for the HICP. The HICP weights include revenues from purchases executed by foreigners in the Czech Republic, but do not include the imputed rental, in contrast to the national index of consumer prices, which does not include revenues from purchases by foreigners yet includes the imputed rental.
In the harmonised indices of consumer prices table, the HICP uses chain weights, which are modified every year in December. National accounts data (final monetary consumption of households) are the source for updates. The average of the year 2015 is used as the price index base.
The indices refer to the 12 divisions of the ECOICOP classification.
