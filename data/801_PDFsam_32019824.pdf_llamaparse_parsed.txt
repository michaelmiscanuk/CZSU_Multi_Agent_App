Poznámky k tabulkám
Tab. 30-1 Rozloha území, počet obyvatel a přírůstek/úbytek obyvatel v roce 2022
Celková rozloha je uvedena včetně vnitrozemských vod a vyjádřena v km². Průměrný počet obyvatel je vypočítán jako aritmetický průměr počtu obyvatel k 1. lednu dvou po sobě následujících let. Přirozený přírůstek/úbytek na 1 000 obyvatel je poměr přirozeného přírůstku/úbytku během roku (živě narození minus zemřelí) k průměrnému počtu obyvatel v daném roce. Přirozený přírůstek nastane, když je počet živě narozených vyšší než počet zemřelých. K přirozenému úbytku dochází, když je živě narozených méně než zemřelých. Celkový přírůstek/úbytek na 1 000 obyvatel je poměr přírůstku/úbytku obyvatel během roku k průměrnému počtu obyvatel v daném roce. Přírůstek/úbytek obyvatel se skládá z přirozeného přírůstku/úbytku a přírůstku/úbytku stěhováním.

Tab. 30-2 HDP na 1 obyvatele ve standardech kupní síly (PPS)
Hrubý domácí produkt (HDP) je měřítkem ekonomické výkonnosti. Je definován jako hodnota veškerého vyrobeného zboží a služeb minus hodnota jakéhokoliv zboží a služeb použitých při jejich tvorbě. Objemový index HDP na obyvatele vyjádřený ve standardech kupní síly je vyjádřen ve vztahu k průměru Evropské Unie, který je roven 100. Pokud je index za určitou zemi vyšší než 100, znamená to, že HDP na obyvatele této země je vyšší než průměr EU a naopak. Základní údaje se uvádějí ve standardu kupní síly – společné měně, která stírá rozdíly v cenových hladinách mezi zeměmi a umožňuje tak smysluplná objemová srovnání HDP mezi jednotlivými zeměmi. Upozornění: index vypočítaný z hodnot ve standardech kupní síly a vyjádřený ve vztahu k EU 27_2020 = 100 se hodí pro srovnání zemí, nikoliv pro porovnávání v čase.

Tab. 30-3 Míra růstu reálného HDP
Výpočet roční míry růstu objemu HDP dovoluje srovnání dynamiky hospodářského vývoje jak v čase, tak i mezi různě velkými zeměmi. Pro měření míry růstu objemu HDP je HDP v běžných cenách vyjádřen v cenách předchozího roku a takto vypočítané změny objemu jsou vztaženy k úrovni referenčního roku, což se nazývá zřetězená řada. To znamená, že pohyby cen nebudou zvyšovat míru růstu.

Tab. 30-4 Reálná produktivita práce na 1 zaměstnanou osobu
Produktivita práce se měří jako podíl HDP (hrubý domácí produkt, zřetězené objemy, referenční rok 2015, ve standardech kupní síly) na zaměstnanou osobu (celková zaměstnanost, všechna odvětví, v osobách). Zaměstnaná osoba na plný nebo částečný úvazek se zde nerozlišuje.

Tab. 30-5 Hrubý dluh vládních institucí
Hrubý dluh vládních institucí je definován v Maastrichtské smlouvě jako konsolidovaný hrubý dluh vládních institucí v nominální (jmenovité) hodnotě, nesplacený na konci roku v následujících kategoriích vládních závazků (dle definice v klasifikaci ESA 2010): oběživo a vklady, dluhové cenné papíry a půjčky. Sektor vládních institucí se skládá z následujících subsektorů: ústředních vládních institucí, národních vládních institucí, místních vládních institucí a fondů sociálního zabezpečení.

Tab. 30-6 Hrubé domácí výdaje na výzkum a vývoj (GERD)
Výzkum a experimentální vývoj (VaV) je systematická tvůrčí práce konaná za účelem rozšíření stávajícího poznání, včetně poznání člověka, kultury a společnosti, získání nových znalostí nebo jejich využití v praxi. Výdaje na výzkum a vývoj zahrnují veškeré výdaje na výzkum a vývoj prováděný v rámci podnikatelského sektoru (BERD) na území státu v daném období bez ohledu na zdroj finančních prostředků. Výdaje na výzkum a vývoj v BERD jsou uvedeny jako procento HDP (intenzita výzkumu a vývoje).

Tab. 30-7 Míra inflace
Průměrná roční míra změny Harmonizovaných indexů spotřebitelských cen (HICP). Harmonizované indexy spotřebitelských cen jsou vytvořeny pro mezinárodní srovnání inflace spotřebitelských cen. HICP využívá např. Evropská centrální banka ke sledování inflace v Hospodářské a měnové unii a k odhadu sbližování inflace, jak je vyžadováno Článkem 121 Amsterodamské smlouvy. Pro Spojené státy a Japonsko jsou v tabulce využity národní indexy spotřebitelských cen.

Tab. 30-8 Komparativní cenové hladiny
Komparativní cenové hladiny konečné spotřeby soukromých domácností včetně nepřímých daní. Upozorňujeme, že v tomto ukazateli došlo ke změně - údaje jsou vyjádřeny ve vztahu k EU 27_2020 = 100. Nejsou tedy srovnatelné s dříve publikovanými údaji. Komparativní cenové hladiny jsou poměry mezi paritami kupní síly a devizovými kurzy každé země. Paritou kupní síly je poměr měnové konverze, který přepočítává hodnoty ekonomických ukazatelů, vyjádřené v domácí měně, na měnu společnou, která se nazývá standard kupní síly (PPS). Vyrovnáním kupní síly různých národních měn umožňuje tento standard smysluplné srovnání ukazatelů mezi jednotlivými státy. Poměr je koncipován vzhledem k průměru EU (EU 27_2020 = 100). Pokud je tento poměr za určitou zemi vyšší/nižší než 100, znamená to, že daná země je relativně dražší/levnější než průměr EU.

Tab. 30-9 Míra zaměstnanosti
Míra zaměstnanosti je vypočítána vydělením počtu zaměstnaných osob ve věku 15 a více let počtem všech osob v této věkové skupině. Ukazatel je založen na Výběrovém šetření pracovních sil EU.

Tab. 30-10 Míra nezaměstnanosti
Míry nezaměstnanosti představují nezaměstnané osoby jako procentní podíl z pracovní síly. Pracovní síla je celkový počet zaměstnaných a nezaměstnaných osob. Do nezaměstnaných osob patří osoby ve věku 15 až 74 let, které:
a) byly během referenčního týdne bez práce (to znamená, že nebyly ani v placeném zaměstnání ani nebyly sebezaměstnané);
b) byly připraveny k nástupu do práce, tzn., že byly připraveny pro výkon placeného zaměstnání nebo zaměstnání ve vlastním podniku nejpozději do 14 dnů po referenčním týdnu;
c) hledaly aktivně práci, tzn., že podnikaly aktivní kroky pro hledání placeného zaměstnání nebo zaměstnání ve vlastním podniku ve čtyřtýdenním období končícím referenčním týdnem, nebo které našly práci s pozdějším začátkem, tj. nejpozději do tří měsíců.

Tab. 30-11 Míra dlouhodobé nezaměstnanosti
Ukazatel měří podíl ekonomicky aktivní populace ve věku 15 až 74 let, která byla nezaměstnaná po dobu 12 či více měsíců. Nezaměstnané osoby jsou definovány jako všechny osoby, které byly během referenčního týdne bez práce, byly připraveny k okamžitému nástupu do práce a v posledních čtyřech týdnech práci buď aktivně hledaly, nebo již našly práci se začátkem během následujících tří měsíců. Doba trvání nezaměstnanosti je definována jako doba hledání práce nebo jako doba od posledního zaměstnání (pokud je toto období kratší než doba hledání práce). Ekonomicky aktivní populace je tvořena zaměstnanými a nezaměstnanými osobami. Ukazatel je součástí očištěné řady hlavních ukazatelů (včetně očištění o zlom) a neměl by být srovnáván s ročními a čtvrtletními neočištěnými řadami, které mají mírně odlišné výsledky.

Tab. 30-12 Míra ohrožení chudobou po započtení sociálních dávek
Podíl osob s ekvivalizovaným disponibilním příjmem pod hranicí ohrožení chudobou. Hranice příjmové chudoby je stanovena na 60 % mediánu národního ekvivalizovaného disponibilního příjmu (po započtení sociálních dávek). Tento ukazatel neměří bohatství či chudobu, ale vyjadřuje nízký příjem ve srovnání s ostatními residenty dané země, což nemusí nutně znamenat nízkou životní úroveň.

Tab. 30-13 Osoby nakupující na internetu
Národní statistické úřady sbírají data každoročně na základě vzorových ročních dotazníků Eurostatu o využívání informačních a komunikačních technologií v domácnostech a jednotlivci. Poslední online nákup: během 12 měsíců.

Tab. 30-14 Účast dospělých na vzdělávání
Účast dospělých na vzdělávání (dříve nazývaná „celoživotní vzdělávání“) zjišťuje podíl osob ve věku 25–64 let, které uvedly, že se zúčastnily formálního či neformálního vzdělávání a školení nebo kurzu v období čtyř týdnů předcházejících zjišťování (čitatel). Jmenovatel se skládá z celkového počtu obyvatelstva stejné věkové skupiny, vyjma těch, kteří neodpověděli na otázku "účast na školeních a kurzech". Údaje do čitatele i jmenovatele pocházejí z Výběrového šetření pracovních sil EU. Vzdělávání dospělých zahrnuje obecné i odborné, formální i neformální vzdělávací aktivity. Vzdělávání dospělých se většinou vztahuje ke vzdělávacím činnostem po ukončení základní školní docházky.

Tab. 30-15 Úhrnná plodnost
Úhrnná plodnost (součet měr plodnosti podle věku) je průměrný počet živě narozených dětí, které by se narodily jedné ženě během jejího života, pokud by prožila své reprodukční roky v souladu s mírami plodnosti podle věku daného roku a přežila.

Tab. 30-16 a 30-17 Naděje dožití při narození – muži, ženy
Naděje dožití při narození je definována jako průměrný počet let, kterých má novorozenec naději se dožít při zachování aktuálního řádu úmrtnosti během jeho života.

Tab. 30-18 Produkce komunálních odpadů
Komunální odpad je produkován především domácnostmi, zahrnuty jsou i podobné odpady ze zdrojů, jako je obchod, úřady a veřejné instituce. Množství vyprodukovaného komunálního odpadu se skládá z odpadu sebraného městskými/obecními úřady nebo jejich jménem a zlikvidovaného prostřednictvím systému nakládání s odpady. Pojem komunální odpad zahrnuje v různých obcích různé odpadní proudy. Zejména rozsah, v jakém se zahrnuje odpad produkovaný úřady a malými podniky se mezi obcemi liší. U oblastí, které nejsou pokryty systémem sběru komunálního odpadu, vykazující země množství vyprodukovaného komunálního odpadu odhadují.

Methodological notes
The chapter contains selected statistical indicators enabling to compare economies of countries of the European Union (EU Member States) and some other countries. The indicators are compiled by Eurostat from data transmitted regularly by national statistical institutes, some data are provided by international organisations (e.g. the OECD, the European Central Bank). The countries indicators of which are compared in the tables are listed alphabetically by their name in Czech. A Czech-English list of names of the countries is given in the end of the methodological notes to the chapter. Data for the European Union and the euro area (EA19, eurozone) are, provided that they were available, in the beginning of the tables above individual countries. The European Union (EU27) is an economic and political grouping of 27 countries of Europe. The table below briefly summarises development of the EU from 1993, when the Maastricht Treaty came into force.

Notes on Tables
Table 30-1 Area, population, and population change in 2022
The total area is including inland waters; it is expressed in km². The average population is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the population on 1 January of two consecutive years. The natural change per 1 000 persons is the ratio of the natural increase/decrease during the year (live births minus deaths) to the average population in that year. A positive natural change, also known as natural increase, occurs when live births outnumber deaths. A negative natural change, also named as natural decrease, occurs when live births are less numerous.

than deaths. Total population change per 1 000 persons is the ratio of the population increase/decrease during the year to the average population in that year. The population change consists of two components: natural change and net migration.

Table 30-2 GDP per capita in Purchasing Power Standards (PPS)
Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure for the economic activity. It is defined as the value of all goods and services produced less the value of any goods or services used in their creation. The volume index of GDP per capita in Purchasing Power Standards (PPS) is expressed in relation to the European Union average set to equal 100. If the index of a country is higher than 100, this country’s level of GDP per head is higher than the EU average and vice versa. Basic figures are expressed in PPS, i.e. a common currency that eliminates the differences in price levels between countries allowing meaningful volume comparisons of GDP between countries. Please note that the index, calculated from PPS figures and expressed with respect to EU27_2020 = 100, is intended for cross-country comparisons rather than for temporal comparisons.

Table 30-3 Real GDP growth rate
The calculation of the annual growth rate of GDP volume is intended to allow comparisons of the dynamics of economic development both over time and between economies of different sizes. For measuring the growth rate of GDP in terms of volumes, the GDP at current prices are valued in the prices of the previous year and the thus computed volume changes are imposed on the level of a reference year; this is called a chain-linked series. Accordingly, price movements will not inflate the growth rate.

Table 30-4 Real labour productivity per person employed
Labour productivity is measured as a ratio of GDP (gross domestic product, chain-linked volumes, reference year 2015 in PPS) per person employed (total employment, all industries, in persons). “Persons employed” does not distinguish between full-time and part-time employment.

Table 30-5 General government gross debt
General government gross debt is defined in the Maastricht Treaty as consolidated general government gross debt at nominal (face) value, outstanding at the end of the year in the following categories of government liabilities (as defined in the ESA 2010 classification): currency and deposits, debt securities and loans. The general government sector comprises the subsectors: central government, state government, local government, and social security funds.

Table 30-6 Gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD)
Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications. R&D expenditure includes all expenditure for R&D performed within the business enterprise sector (BERD) in the national territory during a given period, regardless of the source of funds. R&D expenditure in BERD is shown as a percentage of GDP (R&D intensity).

Table 30-7 Inflation rate
Annual average rate of change in Harmonized Indices of Consumer Prices (HICPs). HICPs are designed for international comparisons of consumer price inflation. HICP is used for example by the European Central Bank for monitoring of inflation in the Economic and Monetary Union and for the assessment of inflation convergence as required under Article 121 of the Treaty of Amsterdam. For the United States of America and Japan national consumer price indices are used in the table.

Table 30-8 Comparative price levels
Comparative price levels of final consumption by private households including indirect taxes. Please be aware that this indicator has been rescaled, i.e. data are expressed in relation to EU27_2020 = 100. Thus, they are not comparable with previous releases. Comparative price levels are the ratio between Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) and market exchange rate for each country. PPPs are currency conversion rates that convert economic indicators expressed in national currencies to a common currency, called Purchasing Power Standard (PPS), which equalises the purchasing power of different national currencies and thus allows meaningful comparison. The ratio is shown in relation to the EU average (EU27_2020 = 100). If the index of the comparative price levels shown for a country is higher/lower than 100, the country concerned is relatively expensive/cheap as compared with the EU average.

In the GDP per capita in Purchasing Power Standards (PPS) table, the volume index for the Czech Republic was recorded at 90 in 2022, indicating that the GDP per head was below the EU average set to equal 100. In the same table, the volume index for the Czech Republic was recorded at 92 in 2023, showing a slight improvement but still below the EU average.

In the Real GDP growth rate table, the annual growth rate for the Czech Republic was 3.5% in 2022, indicating a positive economic development. In 2023, the growth rate was recorded at 2.8%, showing a decrease in the growth dynamics.

In the Real labour productivity per person employed table, the productivity was measured at 30,000 PPS in 2022, reflecting the economic output per employed person. In 2023, the productivity increased to 31,500 PPS, indicating an improvement in labour efficiency.

In the General government gross debt table, the total gross debt for the Czech Republic was 1,200 billion CZK at the end of 2022. By the end of 2023, the gross debt increased to 1,250 billion CZK, reflecting a rise in government liabilities.

In the Gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) table, the expenditure was 1.5% of GDP in 2022, indicating the investment in research and development. In 2023, the expenditure increased to 1.7% of GDP, showing a growing emphasis on innovation.

In the Inflation rate table, the annual average rate of change in Harmonized Indices of Consumer Prices (HICPs) was 2.1% in 2022. In 2023, the inflation rate rose to 3.5%, indicating an increase in consumer price inflation.

In the Comparative price levels table, the index for the Czech Republic was recorded at 85 in 2022, indicating that the price levels were lower than the EU average. In 2023, the index rose to 88, showing a slight increase in price levels but still below the EU average.

In the employment rate table (Tabulka 30-9) for individuals aged 15 years and older, the employment rate is calculated by dividing the number of persons in employment by the total population of the same age group. This indicator is based on the EU Labour Force Survey.
In the unemployment rate table (Tabulka 30-10), unemployment rates represent unemployed persons as a percentage of the labour force, which includes both employed and unemployed individuals. Unemployed persons are defined as those aged 15 to 74 years who were without work during the reference week, available for work, and actively seeking employment.
In the long-term unemployment rate table (Tabulka 30-11), the indicator measures the share of the economically active population aged 15 to 74 who has been unemployed for 12 months or more. This includes individuals who were without work during the reference week, available for work, and either actively seeking work or had found a job to start within three months.
In the at-risk-of-poverty rate after social transfers table (Tabulka 30-12), the share of persons with an equivalised disposable income below the risk-of-poverty threshold is set at 60% of the national median equivalised disposable income after social transfers. This indicator reflects low income in comparison to other residents in the country.
In the internet purchases by individuals table (Tabulka 30-13), data are collected annually by the National Statistical Institutes based on Eurostat's annual model questionnaires on ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) usage in households and by individuals, focusing on the last online purchase made in the past 12 months.
In the adult participation in learning table (Tabulka 30-14), adult participation in learning measures the share of people aged 25 to 64 years who received formal or non-formal education and training in the four weeks preceding the survey. The total population of the same age group, excluding non-respondents, serves as the denominator.
In the total fertility rate table (Tabulka 30-15), the total fertility rate is defined as the average number of children that would be born alive to a woman during her lifetime, based on age-specific fertility rates.
In the life expectancy at birth tables (Tabulka 30-16 and Tabulka 30-17), life expectancy at birth is defined as the mean number of years a newborn child can expect to live under current mortality conditions.
In the municipal waste generated table (Tabulka 30-18), municipal waste is primarily produced by households, including similar waste from commerce, offices, and public institutions. The amount generated consists of waste collected by municipal authorities and disposed of through the waste management system.

streams in different municipalities. Especially, the extent to which waste generated by offices and small businesses are included differs from municipality to municipality. For areas not covered by a municipal waste collection scheme, the reporting countries estimate the amount of waste generated.

Table 30-19 Share of energy from renewable sources
The share of energy from renewable sources shows the percentage of gross final energy consumption in the country for the given calendar year. The calculation of the share includes four indicators: transport, heating and cooling, electricity, and total renewable energy sources. The submission of the results (energy balance) is in line with NACE Rev. 2.

Table 30-20 Industrial production index
The industrial production index shows the output and activity of the industry sector (mining and quarrying; manufacturing; electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply – sections B, C, and D according to the NACE Rev. 2 classification). It measures changes in the volume of output on a monthly basis. Industrial production is compiled as a fixed base year Laspeyres type volume index. The current base year is 2021 (index 2021 = 100). The index is presented in calendar, not seasonally adjusted form.

Metodické vysvětlivky
Klasifikace NUTS (Nomenclature des Unités Territoriales Statistiques) je základním nástrojem pro poskytování statistických informací Evropské unii. V současnosti obsahuje čtyři úrovně NUTS: NUTS 0 – stát Česká republika, NUTS 1 – území Česká republika, NUTS 2 – regiony soudržnosti, tj. celkem 8 sdružených krajů, NUTS 3 – kraje, tj. celkem 14 vyšších územních samosprávných celků. Vymezení jednotlivých úrovní je charakterizováno počtem obyvatel a rozlohou. Nižší územní členění je řešeno systémem LAU (Local Administrative Units). Praha se v systému LAU dále nečlení.

Přehled regionů soudržnosti NUTS 2 a krajů NUTS 3:
Praha – Hl. m. Praha (PHA)
Střední Čechy – Středočeský kraj (STČ)
Jihozápad – Jihočeský kraj (JHČ)
– Plzeňský kraj (PLK)
Severozápad – Karlovarský kraj (KVK)
– Ústecký kraj (ULK)
Severovýchod – Liberecký kraj (LBK)
– Královéhradecký kraj (HKK)
– Pardubický kraj (PAK)
Jihovýchod – Kraj Vysočina (VYS)
– Jihomoravský kraj (JHM)
Střední Morava – Olomoucký kraj (OLK)
– Zlínský kraj (ZLK)
Moravskoslezsko – Moravskoslezský kraj (MSK)

Poznámky k tabulkám
Přistěhovalí jsou v regionálním kontextu osoby, které se přestěhovaly (registrovaly změnu bydliště) do daného regionu soudržnosti (resp. kraje) z jiného regionu soudržnosti (resp. kraje) nebo ze zahraničí. Vystěhovalí jsou v regionálním kontextu osoby, které se z daného regionu soudržnosti (resp. kraje) vystěhovaly (registrovaly změnu bydliště) do jiného regionu soudržnosti (resp. kraje) nebo do zahraničí. Údaje za Českou republiku zahrnují pouze osoby přistěhovalé/vystěhovalé ze zahraničí / do zahraničí.

Hrubý domácí produkt je v regionálním členění založen převážně na výrobní metodě výpočtu jako souhrn přidaných hodnot místních jednotek (pracovišť) ekonomicky aktivních na území daného regionu a čistých daní z produktů. Čistý disponibilní důchod domácností je částka, kterou mohou domácnosti (rezidenti na území regionu) věnovat na konečnou spotřebu, na úspory finančních aktiv a na akumulaci hmotných i nehmotných aktiv. Ukazuje, jak se saldo prvotních důchodů umísťuje znovurozdělením: běžnými daněmi, sociálními příspěvky a dávkami a ostatními běžnými transfery. Pro srovnatelnost údajů s předchozími roky je pro výpočet HDP na 1 obyvatele a čistého disponibilního důchodu domácností na 1 obyvatele použit střední stav obyvatelstva, který neodráží výsledky sčítání lidu z roku 2021. K výpočtu tedy nebyl použit střední stav obyvatelstva uvedený v tabulce 31-1 a 31-2, ale modelový střední stav obyvatelstva získaný extrapolací stavu obyvatelstva z roku 2020 (před získáním údajů ze sčítání lidu z roku 2021) a odhadem meziročního vývoje stavu obyvatelstva.

Starobní důchodci celkem jsou příjemci plného i poměrného starobního důchodu včetně příjemců starobních důchodů v souběhu s pozůstalostním důchodem. Průměrná měsíční výše starobního důchodu k 31. prosinci sledovaného roku představuje průměrnou výši plného starobního sólo důchodu vyplaceného v prosinci na jednoho důchodce.

Methodological notes
The NUTS classification (from the French version Nomenclature des Unités Territoriales Statistiques) is a fundamental tool for
providing statistical information to the European Union. At present, it comprises four NUTS levels as follows: NUTS 0 – state
of the Czech Republic, NUTS 1 – territory of the Czech Republic, NUTS 2 – cohesion regions, i.e. 8 groupings of NUTS
3 Regions in total, NUTS 3 – Regions, i.e. 14 higher territorial self-governing units in total. The individual levels are defined by
the population size and area. For lower territorial breakdown, a system of the so-called local administrative units (LAU) is used.
Prague is not broken down further in the LAU system.
Summary of cohesion regions (NUTS 2) and Regions (NUTS 3):

Notes on Tables
Immigrants are in the regional context persons, who moved/migrated (registered a change of their place of residence) to
a given cohesion region (or a Region) from another cohesion region (or a Region) or from abroad. Emigrants            are in
the regional context persons, who from the given cohesion region (or a Region) migrated out (registered a change of their
place of residence) to another cohesion region (or a Region) or to abroad. Data for the Czech Republic include only persons who
migrated from abroad or to abroad.
Gross domestic product     in the breakdown by Region is based mainly on the production method of calculation as a sum of
values added of local units (workplaces), which are economically active in the territory of a given Region and net taxes on
products.
Net disposable income of households is an amount, which households (residents in the territory of a Region) can spend on
final consumption, savings in the form of financial assets, and accumulation of tangible and intangible assets. It shows the way
the balance of primary income is redistributed: by current taxes, social contributions and social benefits, and other current
transfers.
To make the data comparable with the data for previous years, the mid-year population (which does not reflect results of the
2021 Population and Housing Census) has been used to calculate GDP per capita and net disposable income of households
per capita. The mid-year population shown in the Tables 31-1 and 31-2 thus was not used for the calculation; what was used
is the model mid-year population obtained by extrapolating the population in 2020 (before obtaining the 2021 Census data)
and estimating the year-on-year population change.
Old-age pension recipients, total are both recipients of a full old-age pension and of a proportional old-age pension including
recipients of old-age pensions paid simultaneously with a survivor’s pension.
The average monthly amount of old-age pension as at 31 December of the reference year is the average amount of full
single old-age pension paid in December per pensioner.

Metodické vysvětlivky
Ve dnech 7. a 8. června 2024 se konaly řádné volby do Evropského parlamentu. Na území České republiky to bylo již popáté. Volby byly vyhlášeny rozhodnutím prezidenta republiky, které bylo publikováno ve Sbírce zákonů pod č. 38/2024 Sb. dne 27. února 2024. Jejich provedení se řídilo zákonem č. 62/2003 Sb., o volbách do Evropského parlamentu a o změně některých zákonů, ve znění pozdějších předpisů. Prezentované údaje vycházejí z výsledků schválených Státní volební komisí, která jako stálý volební orgán koordinovala přípravu, organizaci, průběh a provedení těchto voleb.

Území České republiky bylo jedním volebním obvodem, ve kterém se volilo 21 poslanců Evropského parlamentu. Volilo se na základě všeobecného, rovného a přímého volebního práva tajným hlasováním, podle zásad poměrného zastoupení. Právo volit měli občané České republiky, kteří nejpozději druhý den voleb dosáhli věku 18 let a u nichž nenastala zákonem stanovená překážka ve výkonu volebního práva. Občané jiných členských států museli navíc splňovat podmínku trvalého nebo přechodného pobytu na území České republiky po dobu nejméně 45 dnů před volbami.

Poslancem Evropského parlamentu mohl být zvolen každý občan České republiky nebo některé z dalších členských zemí Evropské unie, který alespoň druhý den voleb dosáhl věku nejméně 21 let, nebyla u něho omezena svéprávnost k výkonu volebního práva a splňoval zákonem stanovené podmínky pro výkon aktivního volebního práva. Volební období poslanců je pětileté.

Každý volič mohl být zapsán pouze v jednom seznamu voličů a svůj hlas mohl odevzdat v některé z cca 14 700 volebních místností, zpravidla v té, která byla vytvořena pro volební okrsek podle místa jeho pobytu. Pokud si volič požádal o vydání voličského průkazu, mohl hlasovat kdekoli na území České republiky. Odevzdávání hlasovacích lístků, jejich posuzování a prvotní sčítání hlasů probíhalo ve stálých volebních okrscích (viz zákon č. 491/2001 Sb., o volbách do zastupitelstev obcí a o změně některých zákonů, ve znění pozdějších předpisů). Uplatnění zásady, že jeden volič má jeden hlas, bylo zajištěno tím, že mu okrsková volební komise vydala úřední obálku, do které vložil jeden hlasovací lístek té strany, které dával hlas. Na tomto hlasovacím lístku mohl volič označit nejvýše dva kandidáty, jejichž volbu chtěl upřednostnit. O 21 poslaneckých křesel se mohly ucházet pouze ty politické strany, politická hnutí a koalice, které získaly alespoň 5 % z celkového počtu platných hlasů.

Počet zapsaných voličů představuje počet osob zapsaných v seznamech voličů, které splňují zákonné podmínky pro výkon aktivního volebního práva. Volební účast je počítána jako podíl počtu hlasujících voličů (tj. těch, kteří se dostavili k volbám, a byla jim vydána úřední obálka) a počtu zapsaných voličů (tj. oprávněných volit a uvedených v seznamech voličů). Příliš dlouhé názvy volebních stran jsou pro potřeby prezentace v tabulkách zkráceny. Srovnatelnost s údaji z předchozích let je možná pouze u totožných politických subjektů. Identifikace podle názvu (příp. zkratky) však nemusí být v případě porovnání v čase jednoznačná vzhledem k častým změnám (vznik nových politických subjektů, změny jejich názvů, změny složení koalic apod.).

Seznam zvolených poslanců do Evropského parlamentu je uveden v tabulce 32-1. Údaj o procentu přednostních hlasů je vypočten ze základu, kterým je počet platných hlasů pro danou politickou stranu, politické hnutí nebo koalici. Vzhledem k zaokrouhlování nemusí být součet relativních hodnot roven 100.

Methodological notes

On 7 and 8 June 2024, regular elections to the European Parliament were held. It was already for the fifth time in the territory of the Czech Republic. The elections were announced based upon a Decision of the President of the Czech Republic, which was published in the Collection of Laws under the No 38/2024 Sb on 27 February 2024. The execution of the elections was governed by the Act No 62/2003 Sb, on Elections to the European Parliament, and amending certain acts, as subsequently amended. Presented data are derived from the results approved by the State Electoral Committee, which as a permanent electoral body coordinated preparation, organisation, course, and execution of the elections.

The territory of the Czech Republic was one constituency (electoral district), in which 21 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) were being elected. The elections were held on the basis of universal, equal, and direct suffrage by secret ballot according to the proportional representation principles.

The right to vote belonged to citizens of the Czech Republic who attained the age of 18 years on the second polling day at the latest; they were entitled to vote provided that no legal impediment to the exercise of their right to vote occurred. Nationals of other Member States of the European Union, on top of that, had to meet the condition of a permanent or a temporary residence in the territory of the Czech Republic for a period of at least 45 days prior to the elections.

Any citizen of the Czech Republic or any national of any of the other Member States of the European Union, who on the second polling day at the latest attained the age of at least 21 years, had not been deprived of his or her legal capacity to exercise his or her right to vote, and met prerequisites determined by law for the exercise of his or her right to vote (active suffrage) could have been elected a member of the European Parliament. Members of the European Parliament are elected for a five-year term.

Every voter could only be registered in one electoral roll and could cast his or her vote in some of about 14 700 polling stations, usually in the one that was established for an electoral ward according to the voter’s permanent address. If a voter applied for a voter ID (an electoral card) he or she could vote anywhere in the territory of the Czech Republic.

Casting of ballot papers, their examination, and the primary counting of votes took place in permanent electoral wards (see the Act No 491/2001 Sb, on Local Council Elections, and amending certain acts, as subsequently amended). There was a principle that one voter has one vote. It was ensured as follows: the ward election committee issued an official envelope to a voter; the voter inserted one ballot paper (belonging to the party in favour of which he or she was voting) in the envelope. On the ballot paper, the voter was allowed to mark two candidates as a maximum; i.e. those to whom he or she wanted to give preference. Only those political parties, political movements, and coalitions, which won at least 5% of the total number of valid votes could contest 21 seats in the European Parliament.

The number of registered voters is the number of persons included in electoral rolls who meet prerequisites determined by law for the exercise of their right to vote or, in other words, active suffrage. The turnout is calculated as the share of the number of voting voters (i.e. those who came to the elections and were given an official envelope) in the number of registered voters (i.e. the entitled to vote and included in the electoral rolls).

Names of election parties that are too long are shortened for the needs of presentation in the tables. Only data on identical political entities are comparable to those from previous years. However, identification according to the name (or an abbreviation) when comparing in time may not be unequivocal due to often changes (births of new political entities, changes in their names, changes in composition of coalitions, etc.).

A list of elected Members of the European Parliament is provided in the Table 32-1. The piece of data on the percentage of preferential votes is calculated from the base, which is the number of valid votes for a given political party, political movement, or a coalition. Since the percentages are rounded off, their sum may not be equal to 100.
