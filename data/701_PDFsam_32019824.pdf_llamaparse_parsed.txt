Methodological notes
Data on the health status of the population and on activities of the health service providers are obtained from the National Health Information System (hereinafter only referred to as the NHIS). The NHIS is defined in the Act on Health Services and Conditions of Their Provision. The NHIS is determined for keeping national health registers and processing of data kept therein. The administration of the NHIS has been delegated by the Ministry of Health to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic (IHIS CR).

Information on health care expenditure pursuant to the System of Health Accounts is derived from data of the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the National Register of Reimbursed Health Services (Národní registr hrazených zdravotních služeb – NRHZS), which is part of the NHIS, and data sources of the CZSO.

The Chapter uses the breakdown of diseases and related health problems according to diagnoses and chapters of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10). Besides the aforementioned sources, the chapter uses structural (employee) wage statistics, namely in the case of data on the average gross monthly wage of medical doctors (physicians) and nurses.

Data on students of and graduates from health fields of education at universities in the Czech Republic were obtained from data sources of the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports, namely from the SIMS database (i.e. Union Information from Students’ Registers).

Notes on Tables
Table 25-1 Acute care hospitals
Health professionals (health workforce; health personnel) - such a person is considered a health professional, who acquired professional qualification for performance of a health care profession pursuant to the legislation in force and who performs activities pertaining to him/her based on the profession.

The full-time equivalent (FTE) = the sum of work hours of individual workers of the health establishments converted using the number of hours of work per week of a full-time employment contract as laid down for a given establishment or workplace. The full-time equivalent is given including contract workers.

A physician – provides preventive, diagnostic, curative, rehabilitative, dispensary, or palliative care. A general nurse – provides nursing care to patients based on a diagnosis made by a physician or a dentist. Furthermore, in co-operation with a physician or a dentist, a general nurse participates in preventive, curative, diagnostic, rehabilitative, palliative, and urgent or dispensary care.

A midwife – provides specialised nursing care for a pregnant woman, a delivering woman, and a woman (mother) up until the sixth week after the delivery (the puerperium), including care for the newborn and nursing care for women in the area of gynaecology.

A healthcare assistant – under an expert’s supervision or under direct control performs ancillary activities within providing health services. For example, he/she performs hygienic care for a patient (e.g. bathing and toileting), helps with positioning or immobilisation of patients, etc.

Health
Hospitalised persons
The number of persons (every person only included once) hospitalised in a given health establishment or in a given department, including foreigners and newborns.
Days of treatment
One day of treatment shall mean a whole calendar day, on which a patient has received all services, which the health services provider provides, including accommodation and board.
The average length of stay (days of treatment)
It is the average length of stay in a hospital department in days. It is calculated as an average number of days of treatment per one case of hospitalised patients in a department.
Tables 25-5 and 25-6 Inpatient care in follow-up care hospitals
A follow-up care hospital – it is a facility that provides care to a patient who has been diagnosed with an underlying condition and has stabilized his or her health, managed a sudden illness or sudden exacerbation of a chronic illness. However, the patient's condition requires follow-up treatment or the provision of, in particular, medical rehabilitation care. Follow-up intensive care may also be provided to patients who are partially or totally dependent on support of vital functions.
Tables 25-7 and 25-8 Inpatient care in mental health hospitals and facilities
A mental health hospital (facility) is a medical facility specialising in the treatment of serious mental illnesses and drug addictions (substance abuse) of hospitalised patients. It is an establishment providing long-term psychiatric care, not acute care.
Table 25-9 Balneological institutions
The data source here is the questionnaire on the activities of a provider of balneological rehabilitation and care filled in by balneological institutions. Balneological care recommended by a physician as an inevitable part of a treatment process and fully covered by health insurance companies is referred to as complete balneological care. Data on the numbers of institutions and of beds for the complete balneological care also include institutions, which terminated their activities during a year.
Table 25-10 Selected infectious diseases of compulsory notification
Data are obtained from the Information System of Infectious Diseases, which is developed and maintained by the National Institute of Public Health and administered by the Ministry of Health. The table furthermore contains data on other infectious diseases from specialised information systems as follows: the Register of Tuberculosis and the National Reference Laboratory for HIV/AIDS.
Tables 25-11 and 25-12 Patients in and visits to outpatient care establishments by speciality and by age
A patient in outpatient care is a person who at least once in a given year received outpatient care covered by a health insurance company. It is an aggregate of natural persons on whom a procedure has been performed during their visit to an outpatient establishment. A visit (contact) is a set of all procedures made when treating a natural person in an outpatient care establishment during a single patient’s visit. A contact with a patient in order to make administrative work (to write out a medical prescription, to confirm a certificate, etc.) is also considered to be a visit (contact). Procedures are performed by a physician/practitioner or by a nurse according to a physician’s instructions. The number of contacts includes consultations over the phone and electronic consultations.
Tables 25-13 and 25-14 Newly notified malignant neoplasms
Data in the table are based on data from the National Cancer Register (in Czech abbreviated as NOR), which is part of the National Health Information System (in Czech abbreviated as NZIS). The National Cancer Register (NOR) is a nationwide population register, which has been in operation since 1976, and the purpose of which is to register oncological diseases and to periodically monitor their further development. In the table, all malignant neoplasms are included, except for other malignant neoplasms of skin, i.e. C00–97 excluding C44 according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10).

Tables 25-15 and 25-16 Diabetics under treatment It applies to patients treated by medicines used in diabetes (ATC subgroup/code A10) for type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus regardless of whether they are treated at the diabetology (including outpatient parts of hospitals) or in a surgery of a general practitioner for adults. The status as at 31 December of the reference year is shown. Diabetic patients only treated by a diet are not included here.

Table 25-17 Expenditure on health care by source of financing and type of health care provided Data in the table have been processed based on the System of Health Accounts (SHA) according to the OECD unified methodology (therefore, they are internationally comparable). Only current expenditure is included in the total health care expenditure within the System of Health Accounts. The following items financed directly from the state budget are excluded from surveyed data:
i) expenditure on construction and reconstruction of health establishments,
ii) investment expenditure on purchase and modernisation of instrumentation/equipment,
iii) expenditure on health research and development,
iv) expenditure on education of medical staff (health professionals).

Expenditure of health insurance companies includes reimbursements from the obligatory public health insurance on health care reported by health establishments and recognised by health insurance companies. Revenue of health insurance companies comes from the public health insurance in which every person with permanent residence in the territory of the Czech Republic is obliged to participate. State budget expenditure mainly includes support to long-term care establishments (e.g. retirement homes). Administration of the sector of the Ministry of Health is also covered from the state budget, i.e. operation of the Ministry of Health, health departments of individual regional authorities, public health authorities, the National Institute of Public Health, the State Institute for Drug Control, and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the CR. In 2020, the following were covered from the state budget: payment of hospitals’ debt and purchase of personal protective equipment in relation to the COVID-19 disease pandemic.

Regional/local government budgets include financial means on health care from budgets of Regions and municipalities and relating, for example, to operation of the ambulance service. Household out-of-pocket payment (direct expenditure of households) includes direct expenditure of health care recipients (patients) and their co-payments. It includes the population expenditure on medicines (co-payments for prescribed medicines and full payments for over-the-counter medicines), for medical devices, payments for above-standard services at dentists, for spa treatment stays, above-standard rooms in hospitals, and payments for various certificates. Voluntary health insurance only comprises travel insurance. Except for additional travel insurance, the population of the Czech Republic cannot use other voluntary health insurance to cover health care. Non-profit organisations include expenditure on health care covered by non-profit non-state institutions (e.g. the Red Cross). Activities of these institutions are financed from voluntary contributions of households and from government transfers or subsidies/grants. Company-funded preventive health care (enterprise financing schemes) includes costs for performed routine check-ups and medical examinations of own employees, provided that they have not been covered from the public health insurance.

Curative care is a summary of health services to patients that especially include making a diagnosis, making corresponding medical examinations, determining how to treat a disease (eliminate pain and health problems), providing treatment by means of necessary procedures including using of medicines and corresponding healthcare products, and following observation of the health status. Inpatient curative care includes formal reception to a health establishment for treatment, rehabilitation, or long-term care for which an overnight stay is expected. Inpatient care is not limited as for the type of provider. Most often, the provider is a hospital, but it can also be nursing care facilities/establishments or establishments classified as providers of outpatient care, which provide occasional procedures requiring inpatient care and therefore they are able to provide overnight accommodation. Outpatient curative care includes medical and ancillary services provided to a patient who has not been formally received to an establishment and does not stay in the establishment overnight. Outpatient care can be provided in hospitals or by general practitioners and specialists in private health establishments or in individual surgeries. Day curative care includes planned medical procedures performed by physicians and paramedical personnel (non-physicians) provided to patients formally received to a health establishment for diagnosis to be made, for treatment or other types of health care. A patient is received and released on the same day. Home-based curative care includes medical services, ancillary services, and nursing services (care services), which are provided to patients in their homes and include physical presence of a provider. They include, for example, home obstetric services, home dialysis and all other health care services consumed in a home-setting, regardless of the provider. Assisted living facilities are not included in this category.

Rehabilitative care is a summary of health services provided in rehabilitation establishments (including balneological ones) aimed at elimination of health limitations and health problems experienced by a patient and at repeated achieving of a corresponding health condition (usually after medical care has been provided).

Long-term health care comprises a range of services of medical care and personal care that are consumed with the primary goal to relieve pain and suffering and to reduce or manage deterioration of health condition of patients with a level of long-term dependence.

Ancillary services include laboratory diagnostics and medical imaging diagnostics (X-ray imaging, computerised tomography (CT), magnetic resonance, etc.) and also transport of patients (it also applies to the ambulance service).

Medical goods (non-specified by function) are determined to be used for diagnostics, mitigating a disease’s effect, or treating a disease including prescribed medicines and over-the-counter medicines. Expenditure on medicines consumed in inpatient health establishments is not included.

Preventive care includes immunisation programmes (vaccinations), programmes for early detection of a disease (e.g. screenings of malignant tumours), regular routine check-ups/examinations (e.g. examinations during pregnancy, check-ups of growth and development of children, regular check-ups at the dentist, and general routine check-ups). Preventive care also includes expenditure on information and counselling programmes such as information about health consequences of smoking, drinking of alcohol, unhealthy diet, or insufficient physical activity. In 2020 and 2021, this category also includes costs for PCR tests and antigen tests for the COVID-19 disease.

Health care system administration focuses on the health system rather than direct health care; it is considered to be a collective service since it is not allocated to specific individuals but benefits all health system users. It directs and supports health system functioning. These services are expected to administer and enhance efficiency and performance of the health system. Included are, for example, formulation and administration of government policy, setting standards, or licensing.

In the expenditure of health insurance companies per capita by sex and age group table (Tabulka 25-18), the data are based on the System of Health Accounts of the Czech Republic. The expenditure that cannot be broken down by age is also included in the total indicator of expenditure per capita of a given sex.

In the expenditure of health insurance companies by selected diagnosis, sex, and by age group table (Tabulka 25-19), the table shows selected diagnoses and chapters of the ICD-10 representing groups with the largest costs incurred for health insurance companies.

In the household expenditure on health care table (Tabulka 25-20), data from the national accounts statistics of the CZSO are the basic source of data for the estimation of household final consumption expenditure on health care. Household expenditure on health care is broken down by an international methodology of the System of Health Accounts (SHA). In 2024, national accounts were revised and the CZSO also published retrospectively data for household expenditure broken down by the new Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP-2018). In connection with the revision, the total household expenditure on health care as well as individual items of the types of health care provided were revised. It is because the COICOP-2018 classification offers a more detailed breakdown than the previous one.

In the other medical non-durable goods category, medical non-durable goods (e.g. adhesive and non-adhesive bandages, hypodermic syringes, first-aid kits, medical hosiery such as elasticated stockings and knee supports, etc.) are included.

In the therapeutic appliances category, all other medical durables including medical technical devices comprise a wide variety of medico-technical devices from hearing aids to wheelchairs (powered and unpowered) and invalid carriages, as well as miscellaneous durable medical products not elsewhere classified such as blood pressure instruments.

In the fatal occupational injuries and occupational diseases table (Tabulka 25-21), a fatal occupational injury is defined as health damage that occurred to employees while fulfilling their work assignments or in direct connection with the fulfilment of these assignments leading to the death of the suffering employee within one year since the day on which an occupational injury was inflicted. The source of data here is the State Labour Inspection Office (in Czech abbreviated as SÚIP).

Occupational diseases are defined according to Section 1 paragraph 1 of the Decree of the Government of the Czech Republic No 290/1995 Sb, establishing the list of occupational diseases as subsequently amended. These diseases are formed due to adverse effects of chemical, physical, biological, or other adverse factors if they were formed under conditions enlisted on the List of Occupational Diseases. An acute poisoning caused by adverse effects of chemicals shall also be taken as an occupational disease. A considerable break in the growth of the total number of recognised cases of occupational diseases in the Czech Republic was caused by the recognition of the COVID-19 disease as an occupational disease under new registration codes.

Risk of occupational disease shall mean, according to the Section 347 of the Act No 262/2006 Sb, the Labour Code, such changes to the health status that were formed while performing work due to adverse effects of conditions under which occupational diseases may occur, however, they do not reach the level of health damage, which can be assessed as an occupational disease and continuation in the work performance under the same conditions would lead to the formation of an occupational disease.

Occupational diseases and risks of occupational diseases are registered in the National Register of Occupational Diseases, which forms a part of the National Health Information System according to the Act No 372/2011 Sb, on Health Services. The IHIS CR is an administrator of the Register and data processing is carried out by the Centre for Occupational Health at the National Institute of Public Health.

Table 25-22 Health professionals
The National Register of Health Professionals (in Czech abbreviated as NRZP) is the data source; the category of “other health care personnel” is grossed up from the E(MZ)4-01 statistical questionnaire (report). Dentists perform prevention, make a diagnosis, and treat diseases, injuries, and malformations of the (set of) teeth, mouth, jaws, and related tissues. They use a variety of specialised diagnostic, surgical, and other methods to promote and restore oral health.

Pharmacists store, preserve, prepare, and dispense medicinal products in accordance with medical regulations and provide advice on the correct use and adverse side effects of medicines. They contribute to the research, preparation, prescription, and monitoring of drug therapies to optimise human health.

Paramedics provide emergency medical treatment and transport injured, sick, and otherwise physically and mentally ill persons to health establishments. Other health professionals perform technical tasks and provide support services in the areas of dentistry, medical records administration, community health care, vision correction (for those with reduced ability to see), physiotherapy, public health protection, urgent medical assistance/treatment, and activities to promote and enhance human health. This category includes, for example, dental hygienists, physiotherapy technicians and assistants, optometrists, medical assistants, and others. Other health care personnel are indirectly involved in care for patients (e.g. a cook, a cleaner, a maintenance worker).

Tables 25-23 and 25-24 Wages of health professionals in inpatient health establishments
Classification of Occupations (CZ-ISCO) was used to define selected groups of health professionals. The following two categories of employees in the health sector were selected by means of the classification: 221 Medical doctors (except for dentists); 222+322 Nursing and midwifery professionals and Nursing and midwifery associate professionals, who are further split into: 222 Nursing and midwifery professionals; 322 Nursing and midwifery associate professionals. The difference between nurses (general nurses) and midwives with a speciality (specialism) and the nurses (general nurses) and midwives without a speciality (specialism) should be determined according to the character of work they perform. The qualification in a speciality (specialism) is confirmed by a certificate in the relevant field, which a nurse obtains after she passes a medical certification examination before the medical certification committee. Nurses (general nurses) and midwives with a speciality (specialism) include, for example, ward sisters (charge nurses), nurses and midwives for intensive care and operating theatre (operating room) nurses, and further e.g. paediatric nurses and nurses for internal medicine and surgical fields. Sisters without a speciality (specialism) include nurses of general practitioners and dentists and other outpatient specialists. Besides those categories of nurses, also the following work in the health sector: hospital matrons and principal nursing officers (head nurses / nurses in charge) (ISCO 13424) and medical assistants (ISCO 3256), who are not part of the aforementioned (general) nurses / nursing and midwifery professionals.

Data on wages of medical doctors (physicians in Table 25-23) and nursing and midwifery professionals and nursing and midwifery associate professionals (general nurses and midwives in Table 25-24) in inpatient health establishments come from the structural employee wage statistics. The structural wage statistics is generated by merging of data from the sample survey of the Average Earning Information System of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, which covers the wage sphere, and of the administrative data source of the Salary Information System of the Ministry of Finance, which exhaustively covers the salary sphere.

Inpatient health establishments are all establishments providing acute, follow-up, long-term, or mental (psychiatric) inpatient care classified according to the Classification of Economic Activities (CZ-NACE) by their principal activity to the 86.1 group. It mainly applies to hospitals including specialist hospitals (e.g. mental health hospitals or maternity hospitals), however, therapeutic institutions (long-term hospitals, balneological institutions, etc.) and rehabilitation institutes belong there, too. Data on wages of medical doctors (physicians) and nursing and midwifery professionals employed in those establishments are also included in cases when they only work in their outpatient parts.

The wage sphere includes all private health establishments including regional and municipal hospitals (joint stock companies). The salary sphere includes health establishments directly controlled by the Ministry of Health (e.g. university/teaching hospitals and specialised therapeutic institutions / medical institutes) or semi-budgetary organisations of Regions.

Table 25-25 Students of and graduates from health fields of education at universities
Data on students of and graduates from health fields of education were obtained from the SIMS database (i.e. Union Information from Students’ Registers). The source database of SIMS is continually completed and updated, including retrospective corrections. Data published in this publication correspond to the state of processing as at 20 January 2024. Data on students of universities are always related to 31 December of the relevant year; data on graduates are related to the entire school year. Health studies are specified based on the ISCED Fields of Education and Training 2013 classification (the Czech version: CZ-ISCED-F 2013), namely by means of its narrow field 091 Health, which includes the following detailed fields of education: Dental studies (0911); Medicine (0912) – it mainly comprises preparation of doctors; Nursing and midwifery (0913); Medical diagnostic and treatment technology (0914); Therapy and rehabilitation (0915); Pharmacy (0916); Traditional and complementary medicine and therapy (0917). Numbers of students and graduates are given as headcount, i.e. each student is included in a particular piece of data only once, including students who study in more study programmes at the same time. The total numbers of students and graduates thus do not have to be equal to the sums of students and graduates of respective types of study programmes.

Sociální zabezpečení (Social security) je důležitým tématem v oblasti sociální politiky. Zajišťuje ochranu jednotlivců a rodin před ekonomickými riziky, jako jsou nezaměstnanost, nemoc, invalidita a stáří. V České republice je systém sociálního zabezpečení založen na principu solidarity a zahrnuje různé formy podpory, jako jsou důchody, nemocenské dávky a příspěvky na péči.

Sociální zabezpečení hraje klíčovou roli v ochraně životní úrovně občanů a přispívá k sociální stabilitě a soudržnosti společnosti. Je důležité, aby byl systém efektivní a udržitelný, což vyžaduje pravidelnou revizi a přizpůsobení aktuálním potřebám populace.

Sociální zabezpečení je hlavním nástrojem sociální politiky a zahrnuje systém důchodového pojištění, nemocenského pojištění, státní sociální podporu, pomoc v hmotné nouzi, poskytování sociálních služeb (včetně příspěvku na péči) a další dávkové systémy.

Důchodové pojištění zajišťuje občany pro případ stáří, invalidity nebo při ztrátě živitele. Ze základního důchodového pojištění se poskytují důchody starobní, invalidní a pozůstalostní. Systém je průběžně financován a právní úprava je jednotná pro všechny pojištěnce podle zákona č. 155/1995 Sb., o důchodovém pojištění, ve znění pozdějších předpisů (dále jen zákon o důchodovém pojištění).

Systém nemocenského pojištění je určen pro výdělečně činné osoby, které při ztrátě příjmu v případech tzv. krátkodobých sociálních událostí (dočasné pracovní neschopnosti z důvodu nemoci nebo úrazu či karantény, ošetřování člena rodiny, těhotenství a mateřství, péče o dítě) zabezpečuje peněžitými dávkami nemocenského pojištění. Na nemocenském pojištění jsou povinně účastni zaměstnanci (vč. příslušníků ozbrojených sil a bezpečnostních sborů), zatímco u osob samostatně výdělečně činných zůstává nemocenské pojištění dobrovolné. Od roku 2009 je toto pojištění komplexně upraveno zákonem č. 187/2006 Sb., o nemocenském pojištění, ve znění pozdějších předpisů (dále jen zákon o nemocenském pojištění). Systém nemocenského pojištění tvořilo v roce 2023 následujících šest dávek: nemocenské, ošetřovné, peněžitá pomoc v mateřství, vyrovnávací příspěvek v těhotenství a mateřství, otcovská poporodní péče (otcovská) a dlouhodobé ošetřovné.

Systém státní sociální podpory je upraven zákonem č. 117/1995 Sb., o státní sociální podpoře, ve znění pozdějších předpisů (dále jen zákon o státní sociální podpoře). Dávky státní sociální podpory zahrnují přídavek na dítě, rodičovský příspěvek, příspěvek na bydlení, porodné a pohřebné. Některé z nich (přídavek na dítě, příspěvek na bydlení, porodné) se poskytují v závislosti na výši příjmu žadatele a společně posuzovaných osob. V roce 2022 a 2023 do tohoto okruhu dávek spadá také jednorázový příspěvek na dítě.

Dávky pěstounské péče, které byly do konce roku 2012 upraveny zákonem o státní sociální podpoře, jsou od roku 2013 obsaženy v zákoně č. 359/1999 Sb., o sociálně-právní ochraně dětí, ve znění pozdějších předpisů. Pěstounská péče je dítěti poskytována osobou v evidenci, která vykonává pěstounskou péči na přechodnou dobu, nebo osobou pečující (zejména pěstoun nebo poručník). V roce 2023 existovaly následující druhy dávek pěstounské péče: příspěvek na úhradu potřeb dítěte, odměna pěstouna, příspěvek při pěstounské péči, zaopatřovací příspěvek, příspěvek při převzetí dítěte a příspěvek na zakoupení osobního motorového vozidla.

Systém pomoci v hmotné nouzi je upraven zákonem č. 111/2006 Sb., o pomoci v hmotné nouzi, ve znění pozdějších předpisů. Jedná se o formu pomoci osobám s nedostatečnými příjmy, která má motivovat k aktivní snaze zajistit si prostředky k uspokojování základních životních potřeb a zabránit sociálnímu vyloučení. Stanovuje, že každá osoba má nárok na poskytnutí základních informací, které vedou nejenom k řešení její současné situace, ale i k předcházení vzniku hmotné nouze. Systém pomoci v hmotné nouzi zahrnuje příspěvek na živobytí, doplatek na bydlení a mimořádnou okamžitou pomoc. Od roku 2022 je z hlediska rozpočtové skladby do tohoto systému dávek zařazena humanitární dávka poskytovaná občanům Ukrajiny s dočasnou ochranou.

Dávky pro osoby se zdravotním postižením, tj. příspěvek na mobilitu a příspěvek na zvláštní pomůcku, byly zavedené od roku 2012 zákonem č. 329/2011 Sb., o poskytování dávek osobám se zdravotním postižením a o změně souvisejících zákonů, ve znění pozdějších předpisů.

Zákonem č. 108/2006 Sb., o sociálních službách (s účinností od 1. ledna 2007) byl zaveden příspěvek na péči. Na tuto dávku má nárok osoba, která z důvodu dlouhodobě nepříznivého zdravotního stavu potřebuje v zákonem stanoveném rozsahu pomoc jiné fyzické osoby při péči o vlastní osobu a při zajištění soběstačnosti. Osoba může z příspěvku na základě vlastní svobodné volby hradit profesionální sociální službu nebo jej použít k pokrytí nezbytných nákladů při zajištění péče v rodině.

Nárok na podporu v nezaměstnanosti má uchazeč o zaměstnání, který splnil podmínky dané zákonem č. 435/2004 Sb., o zaměstnanosti, ve znění pozdějších předpisů.

Náhradní výživné je dávka, která má po přechodnou dobu finančně podpořit nezaopatřené děti v situaci, kdy má rodič z rozhodnutí soudu platit výživné, ale svou vyživovací povinnost neplní. Více viz zákon č. 588/2020 Sb. Dávka byla zavedena od 1. července 2021.

Údaje v tabulkách 26-1 až 26-9 a 26-13 až 26-23 jsou přebírány z Ministerstva práce a sociálních věcí. Údaje v tabulce 26-10 o nově hlášených případech pracovní neschopnosti pro nemoc a úraz zajišťuje Český statistický úřad ve spolupráci s Českou správou sociálního zabezpečení (ČSSZ).

Dávky pro osoby se zdravotním postižením byly zavedené od roku 2012 a nahradily dosavadní systém dávek pro osoby se zdravotním postižením (příspěvek na provoz motorového vozidla, příspěvky na zakoupení, celkovou opravu a zvláštní úpravu motorového vozidla, příspěvek na individuální dopravu, příspěvek na úpravu bytu aj.).
Od roku 2021 jsou v celkových výdajích zahrnuty výdaje na náhradní výživné, od roku 2022 výdaje na humanitární dávku a na jednorázový příspěvek na dítě.
Tab. 26-2 až 26-6 Důchodové pojištění, druhy důchodů
V tabulkách jsou uváděny důchody, které se poskytují podle zákona o důchodovém pojištění. Nejsou v nich zahrnuty údaje týkající se ozbrojených složek Ministerstva obrany, Ministerstva vnitra a Ministerstva spravedlnosti.
Nárok na důchod vzniká splněním podmínek, které se liší u jednotlivých druhů důchodu.
– plný starobní důchod může být pobírán buď po dosažení věkové hranice (důchodového věku), a pak se jedná o řádný starobní důchod, nebo v zákonem stanovené době před dosažením důchodového věku, a pak se jedná o předčasný starobní důchod. Nárok na řádný i předčasný starobní důchod je zároveň podmíněn získáním potřebné doby pojištění. Při odchodu do předčasného důchodu je důchod krácen v souladu s tím, kolik času zbývá do dosažení důchodového věku. Při nesplnění potřebné doby pojištění na plný starobní důchod může pojištěnec po dosažení určené nižší doby pojištění a vyššího zákonem stanoveného věku pobírat poměrný důchod. Od 1. ledna 2023 bylo zavedeno zvýšení starobního důchodu o tzv. výchovné, 500 Kč měsíčně za každé vychované dítě. Nárok na výchovné má ten z rodičů, který o dítě nejvíce pečoval;
– invalidní důchod získá pojištěnec, jehož pracovní schopnost poklesla z důvodu dlouhodobě nepříznivého zdravotního stavu nejméně o 35 % a který nedosáhl věku 65 let nebo důchodového věku, je-li vyšší. Aby mohl být invalidní důchod přiznán, musí být splněna též podmínka potřebné doby pojištění pro nárok na invalidní důchod, nejde-li o invaliditu vzniklou následkem pracovního úrazu, nemoci z povolání nebo z některých příčin souvisejících s obranou státu. Ve věku 65 let nárok na invalidní důchod zaniká a dochází k přeměně na starobní důchod. Podle míry poklesu pracovní schopnosti se invalidita dělí na invaliditu prvního stupně (pokles o 35 % až 49 %), druhého stupně (pokles o 50 % až 69 %) a třetího stupně (pokles o 70 a více %) a od toho se také odvíjí výše invalidního důchodu;
– pozůstalá manželka / pozůstalý manžel má nárok na vdovský/vdovecký důchod pod podmínkou, že zesnulý byl poživatelem starobního nebo invalidního důchodu anebo ke dni smrti splnil podmínky potřebné k nároku na invalidní nebo starobní důchod, anebo zemřel následkem pracovního úrazu (nemoci z povolání). Pokud nejsou splněny zvláštní podmínky pro další výplatu vdovského a vdoveckého důchodu, nárok na tyto důchody zaniká po jednom roce;
– nárok na sirotčí důchod může mít pouze nezaopatřené dítě, jehož zesnulý rodič (osoba, která převzala dítě do péče) splňoval podmínku zákonem stanovené potřebné doby pojištění nebo byl poživatelem starobního nebo invalidního důchodu, anebo zemřel následkem pracovního úrazu (nemoci z povolání);
– uvedené druhy důchodů mohou být vypláceny samostatně, a pak se jedná o tzv. sólo důchody. Vdovské a vdovecké důchody mohou být vypláceny v souběhu se starobním nebo invalidním důchodem (kombinované důchody). Jsou-li současně splněny podmínky nároku na výplatu vdovského nebo vdoveckého důchodu a zároveň starobního nebo invalidního důchodu, platí pravidla pro souběh důchodů.
Tab. 26-3 Příjemci důchodů podle druhu důchodu a pohlaví
V kategorii starobní důchod jsou uvedeni jak příjemci sólo starobního důchodu, tak i příjemci starobního důchodu v souběhu s důchodem vdovským/vdoveckým (kombinované důchody). Do kategorie invalidních důchodů jsou zahrnuti jak příjemci sólo invalidních důchodů, tak příjemci kombinovaných invalidních a vdovských/vdoveckých důchodů.
Naopak v kategorii vdovského a vdoveckého důchodu jsou uvedeni příjemci pouze těchto druhů důchodu (sólo důchody), tedy bez souběhu se starobním nebo invalidním důchodem. Celkový počet příjemců důchodů pak odpovídá součtu kategorií.
Tab. 26-4 Průměrná měsíční výše sólo vyplacených důchodů za prosinec daného roku
Ve všech kategoriích se jedná pouze o sólo vyplácené důchody. Důchody kombinované, vyplácené v souběhu více druhů důchodů, zde nejsou uvedeny.
Tab. 26-5 Příjemci důchodů podle měsíční výše vyplacených důchodů
Příjemci důchodů jsou zde uvedeni dle měsíční výše důchodu vypláceného za prosinec.
Ve všech kategoriích mimo vdovských/vdoveckých důchodů se jedná pouze o sólo vyplácené důchody. Důchody kombinované, vyplácené v souběhu více druhů důchodů, jsou uvedeny pouze u vdovských/vdoveckých důchodů.

Tab. 26-6 Nově přiznané důchody – základní ukazatele podle druhu důchodu
V tabulce nejsou zahrnuty důchody vyplácené do ciziny. Ukazatel průměrné výše nově přiznaných důchodů zahrnuje pouze sólově vyplácené důchody. Pokud pojištěnec splnil podmínky pro plný starobní důchod dosažením věkové hranice (důchodového věku), může k věkové hranici pobírat řádný starobní důchod nebo může dalším výkonem výdělečné činnosti i poté, co splní podmínky nároku na starobní důchod, zvyšovat procentní výměru svého starobního důchodu (odložený odchod). Nárok na invalidní důchod zaniká dosažením věku 65 let, zároveň vzniká nárok na starobní důchod (v tabulce pod označením starobní důchod vzniklý po invalidním důchodu). V roce 2022 došlo k výraznému nárůstu počtu nově přiznaných starobních důchodů, vzhledem k výjimečným valorizacím, kvůli kterým se vyplatilo jít do předčasného starobního důchodu. Vysoký počet žádostí o starobní důchody (zejména ty předčasné) v roce 2022 tak „odčerpal“ potenciální žadatele o starobní důchody v roce následujícím. V roce 2023 proto došlo k výraznému poklesu počtu nově přiznaných starobních důchodů.

Tab. 26-7 až 26-9 Nemocenské pojištění
Ukazatel průměrný počet nemocensky pojištěných osob zahrnuje průměrný počet osob, které jsou nemocensky pojištěny podle zákona o nemocenském pojištění. Údaje uváděné v tabulce zahrnují pouze tzv. civilní sektor, tzn. bez příslušníků Policie ČR, Hasičského záchranného sboru ČR, Celní správy ČR, Vězeňské služby ČR, Bezpečnostní informační služby, Úřadu pro zahraniční styky a informace a vojáků z povolání.

Vymezení jednotlivých druhů dávek nemocenského pojištění:
– nemocenské – zaměstnanec nebo OSVČ, který je uznán ošetřujícím lékařem dočasně práce neschopným, případně při nařízené karanténě, má nárok po zákonem stanovenou dobu na vyplácení nemocenského;
– ošetřovné – je vypláceno zaměstnanci z důvodu ošetřování nemocného člena domácnosti nebo péče o zdravé dítě mladší 10 let (protože školské nebo dětské zařízení bylo uzavřeno, dítěti byla nařízena karanténa, nebo osoba, která jinak o dítě pečuje, sama onemocněla);
– peněžitá pomoc v mateřství – od roku 2011 je vyplácena ode dne, který určí sama pojištěnka, a to v období od počátku osmého do počátku šestého týdne před očekávaným dnem porodu; podpůrčí doba činí 28 týdnů (v případě porodu dvou nebo více dětí činí podpůrčí doba 37 týdnů);
– vyrovnávací příspěvek v těhotenství a mateřství – pobírají zaměstnankyně, které musely být z důvodu těhotenství (mateřství nebo kojení) převedeny na jinou práci, kde dosahují nižšího výdělku;
– dávka otcovské poporodní péče (otcovská) – dávka zavedena od 1. 2. 2018; nárok na dávku má otec dítěte, který o dítě pečuje, pokud nastoupil na otcovskou v období 6 týdnů ode dne narození dítěte; za otce dítěte je považován ten, kdo je v matrice zapsán jako otec; podpůrčí doba činila do konce roku 2021 maximálně 1 týden, od začátku roku 2022 maximálně 2 týdny;
– dlouhodobé ošetřovné – dávka zavedena od 1. 6. 2018; dávka náleží osobě, která dlouhodobě pečuje o osobu, u níž došlo k závažnému zhoršení zdravotního stavu, který vyžadoval alespoň čtyřdenní (do konce roku 2021 alespoň sedmidenní) hospitalizaci v nemocnici, a v den propuštění bylo potvrzeno, že potřeba celodenní péče bude trvat nejméně dalších 30 dnů; výplata dávky nenáleží po dobu, kdy byla ošetřovaná osoba znovu hospitalizována; podpůrčí doba činí maximálně 90 kalendářních dnů.

Tab. 26-10 Pracovní neschopnost pro nemoc a úraz – základní ukazatele
Údaje do roku 2011 vycházejí ze zpracování statistického výkazu ČSÚ; od roku 2012 ČSÚ zajišťuje tyto údaje zpracováním dat z administrativního zdroje Informačního systému České správy sociálního zabezpečení (ČSSZ). Informační systém ČSSZ eviduje případy dočasné pracovní neschopnosti v Česku, které byly ošetřujícím lékařem elektronicky hlášeny přes aplikaci eNeschopenka (do konce roku 2019 pomocí tiskopisu „Rozhodnutí o dočasné pracovní neschopnosti“). Statistika dočasné pracovní neschopnosti zachycuje veškerá onemocnění a úrazy, které zapříčinily alespoň jednodenní pracovní neschopnost u nemocensky pojištěných osob. Administrativní data Informačního systému ČSSZ jsou vykazována za všechny zaměstnance právnických i fyzických osob a zvlášť za osoby samostatně výdělečně činné (OSVČ), jejichž nemocenské pojištění je ovšem dobrovolné. Údaje od roku 2012 nejsou plně srovnatelné s údaji z předchozích let. Nově hlášené případy pracovní neschopnosti jsou evidovány na základě hlášení o vzniku pracovní neschopnosti nemocensky pojištěných osob.

Poznámka: Do počtu nově hlášených případů dočasné pracovní neschopnosti pro nemoc patří i pracovní neschopnosti z důvodu karantény či izolace. V lednu (od 17. 1.) a únoru 2022 při testování zaměstnanců na covid-19 byly některým pracujícím vydány neschopenky pro karanténu či izolaci duplicitně. V zájmu operativního jednání při jejich vyřizování vydávali neschopenky jak praktičtí lékaři, tak krajské hygienické stanice. Z dostupných zdrojových databází však není možné duplicitní případy identifikovat. Tato skutečnost má vliv na další prezentované a z nich odvozené ukazatele (počet kalendářních dnů v pracovní neschopnosti, průměrné procento dočasné pracovní neschopnosti).

Kalendářní dny pracovní neschopnosti představují součet kalendářních dnů v daném roce, po které byli nemocensky pojištění zaměstnanci práce neschopní (na základě hlášení o vzniku a ukončení pracovní neschopnosti). Průměrná doba trvání 1 případu pracovní neschopnosti – ukazatel vyjadřuje, kolik kalendářních dnů pracovní neschopnosti v průměru připadá na jeden nově hlášený případ pracovní neschopnosti. Průměrné procento pracovní neschopnosti vyjadřuje, kolik ze sta pojištěnců je průměrně každý den v pracovní neschopnosti pro nemoc či úraz. Vypočte se takto: (počet kalendářních dnů pracovní neschopnosti x 100) / (průměrný počet nemocensky pojištěných osob x počet kalendářních dnů v daném období). Za pracovní úrazy jsou považovány ty úrazy, které se staly zaměstnancům při plnění pracovních úkolů nebo v přímé souvislosti s nimi a byly nahlášeny ČSSZ.

Tab. 26-11 a 26-12 Ukončené případy pracovní neschopnosti
Údaje o ukončených případech pracovní neschopnosti pro nemoc a úraz (dále jen pracovní neschopnosti) jsou přebírány z České správy sociálního zabezpečení (ČSSZ). Data jsou získána na základě elektronických hlášení od ošetřujícího lékaře přes aplikaci eNeschopenka. Ukončené případy pracovní neschopnosti zahrnují veškerá onemocnění a úrazy, které zapříčinily alespoň jednodenní pracovní neschopnost u nemocensky pojištěných osob ukončenou v daném roce. Nezahrnuje tedy onemocnění a úrazy, u nichž pracovní neschopnost přesahovala do dalšího roku. Kalendářní dny pracovní neschopnosti představují součet kalendářních dnů, po které byli nemocensky pojištění zaměstnanci práce neschopní (na základě hlášení o vzniku a ukončení pracovní neschopnosti). Průměrná doba trvání 1 případu pracovní neschopnosti – ukazatel vyjadřuje, kolik kalendářních dnů pracovní neschopnosti v průměru připadá na jeden ukončený případ pracovní neschopnosti.

Tab. 26-13 Dávky státní sociální podpory
Tabulka obsahuje údaje o ročních výdajích na dávky státní sociální podpory a průměrných měsíčních počtech vyplacených dávek. Vymezení dávek státní sociální podpory:
– přídavek na dítě – je základní dlouhodobou dávkou poskytovanou rodinám s dětmi; nárok mají rodiny s příjmem do zákonem stanoveného násobku životního minima. Výše přídavku je odvozena od věku nezaopatřeného dítěte a druhů příjmů v rodině;
– rodičovský příspěvek – je určen pro toho rodiče, který po celý kalendářní měsíc osobně, celodenně a řádně pečuje o dítě, které je nejmladší v rodině, a to až do vyčerpání celkové částky 300000 Kč, nejdéle do čtyř let věku dítěte. (V případě, že jsou nejmladšími dětmi v rodině dvojčata nebo vícerčata, má rodič nárok na rodičovský příspěvek až do vyčerpání celkové částky 450000 Kč). Do konce roku 2019 se jednalo o částku 220000 Kč, respektive 330000 Kč v případě vícerčat.
– příspěvek na bydlení – touto dávkou stát přispívá na náklady na bydlení rodinám a jednotlivcům s nízkými příjmy; nárok na příspěvek na bydlení má vlastník bytu nebo od roku 2022 osoba, která byt užívá na základě služebnosti (věcného břemena) nebo nájemce (od roku 2022 též podnájemce) celého bytu, jestliže 30 % příjmů rodiny (v Praze 35 %; pozn.: tato hranice platila do konce roku 2022) nestačí k pokrytí nákladů na bydlení a zároveň těchto 30 % příjmů rodiny (v Praze 35 %; pozn.: tato hranice platila do konce roku 2022) je nižší než příslušné normativní náklady stanovené zákonem;
– porodné, pohřebné a jednorázový příspěvek na dítě (vyplácený od července 2022) jsou zahrnuty pouze v kategorii celkem.

Tab. 26-14 Dávky pěstounské péče
Tabulka obsahuje údaje o ročních výdajích na dávky pěstounské péče, průměrných měsíčních počtech vyplacených dávek a o počtu dětí v náhradní rodinné péči k 31. 12. daného roku. Vymezení dávek pěstounské péče:
– příspěvek na úhradu potřeb dítěte – nárok na příspěvek na úhradu potřeb dítěte má nezletilé nezaopatřené dítě svěřené do péče osoby pečující nebo na základě rozhodnutí soudu do péče jiné fyzické osoby než rodiče;
– odměna pěstouna – nárok na odměnu pěstouna má osoba pečující, která poskytuje dítěti zprostředkovanou pěstounskou péči, a osoba v evidenci (pěstoun na přechodnou dobu);
– příspěvek při pěstounské péči – dávka náležející při poskytování nezprostředkované pěstounské péče, tj. tehdy, pokud o dítě osobně pečuje osoba příbuzná nebo blízká, a v dalších zákonem stanovených případech;

Tab. 26-23 Výdaje na sociální ochranu podle základního systému ESSPROS
Evropský systém jednotných statistik sociální ochrany (The European System of integrated Social PROtection Statistics, ESSPROS) byl určen Eurostatem v souladu s nařízením Evropského parlamentu a Rady (ES) č. 458/2007 ze dne 25. dubna 2007, o Evropském systému jednotné statistiky sociální ochrany (ESSPROS). ESSPROS představuje společný rámec, který umožňuje ucelené mezinárodní srovnání administrativních dat v oblasti sociálních dávek domácnostem a jejich financování v členských státech EU. V základním systému ESSPROS je sociální ochrana definována jako souhrn intervencí ze strany veřejných nebo soukromých institucí, jejichž cílem je zmírnění finanční zátěže domácností vyplývající z řady rizik nebo potřeb. Skupiny rizik nebo potřeb se vztahují k jednotlivým funkcím sociální ochrany systému ESSPROS, které jsou stanoveny následovně:
– nemoc/zdravotní péče – peněžní podpora vyplácená v souvislosti s tělesnou nebo duševní nemocí, kromě invalidity; zdravotní péče zaměřená na udržení nebo zlepšení zdravotního stavu osob v systému sociální ochrany bez ohledu na původ nemoci;
– invalidita – peněžní nebo naturální podpora (kromě zdravotní péče), jejímž důvodem je nemožnost tělesně nebo duševně postižených osob vykonávat ekonomickou nebo sociální činnost;
– stáří – peněžní nebo naturální podpora (kromě zdravotní péče) v souvislosti se stářím;
– pozůstalí – peněžní nebo naturální podpora v souvislosti se smrtí člena rodiny;
– rodina/děti – peněžní nebo naturální podpora (kromě zdravotní péče) při výdajích spojených s těhotenstvím, narozením a adopcí dítěte, výchovou dětí a péčí o ostatní členy rodiny;
– nezaměstnanost – peněžní nebo naturální podpora v souvislosti s nezaměstnaností;
– bydlení – pomoc poskytovaná na náklady spojené s bydlením;
– sociální vyloučení jinde neklasifikované – peněžní nebo naturální podpora (kromě zdravotní péče) konkrétně určená k odstranění nebo zmírnění sociálního vyloučení, pokud není poskytována v rámci některé z ostatních funkcí sociální ochrany.

Základní systém řeší sociální ochranu poskytovanou ve formě plateb v hotovosti, náhrad a přímo poskytovaného zboží a služeb domácnostem a jednotlivcům. Metodika výpočtu výdajů na sociální ochranu podle systému ESSPROS je odlišná od metodiky používané k vyjádření výdajů na dávky sociálního zabezpečení používané v ostatních tabulkách této kapitoly.

Methodological notes
The social security scheme is the main instrument of the social policy and consists of the schemes of pension insurance, sickness insurance, state social support, assistance in material need, providing of social services (including care benefit), and other systems of benefits.

The pension insurance scheme provides security to citizens for old age, disability, or death of the breadwinner. The compulsory basic pension insurance scheme provides old-age pensions, disability pensions, and survivors’ pensions (widows’ and widowers’ pensions, and orphan pension). The scheme has continuous funding and the legal regulation is unified for all pension insured persons according to the Act No 155/1995 Sb, on Pension Insurance, as subsequently amended (hereinafter referred to as the Act on Pension Insurance).

The sickness insurance scheme is intended for people in remunerative work, for whom it provides security through financial sickness insurance benefits in cases of the so-called short-term social events (temporary incapacity for work due to a disease, an injury, or quarantine, caring for a family member, pregnancy and maternity, or caring for a child). Sickness insurance is compulsory for employees (including members of the armed forces and security forces), whereas for the self-employed participation in the sickness insurance system remains voluntary. Since 2009, sickness insurance has been fully regulated by the Act No 187/2006 Sb, on Sickness Insurance, as subsequently amended (hereinafter referred to as the Act on Sickness Insurance). The sickness insurance scheme consisted of six benefits in 2023 as follows: sickness benefit, attendance allowance, maternity benefit, pregnancy and maternity compensation benefit, paternity benefit, and long-term attendance allowance.

The system of state social support is regulated by the Act No 117/1995 Sb, on the State Social Support, as subsequently amended (hereinafter referred to as the Act on the State Social Support). State social support benefits include child allowance, parental allowance, housing allowance, birth grant, and funeral grant. Some of them (child allowance, housing allowance, and birth grant) are means-tested and are provided depending on the income of the applicant and persons assessed jointly with the applicant. In 2022 and 2023, this group of benefits also includes a one-off child allowance in the amount of CZK 5000 per child.

Foster care benefits, which were regulated by the Act on State Social Support until the end of 2012, has been forming a part of the Act No 359/1999 Sb, on Social and Legal Protection of Children, as subsequently amended. A child is provided with foster care by a registered person who performs foster care for a temporary period or by a caring person (a foster parent or a guardian in particular). There were the following types of foster care benefits in 2023: a foster child allowance, a foster parent allowance, a foster care allowance, a care leaver’s grant/allowance (a maintenance allowance for young adults leaving foster care), a fostering grant (a grant at the beginning of foster care), and a motor vehicle grant.

The system of assistance in material need is regulated by the Act No 111/2006 Sb, on Assistance in Material Need, as subsequently amended. It is a form of assistance to natural persons having insufficient income that shall motivate the persons to make active efforts to acquire resources to satisfy their basic needs of life and to prevent them from social exclusion. It is established that every person is entitled to get basic information, which not merely assist to solve his/her current conditions yet also prevent occurrence of material need conditions. The system of assistance in material need includes allowance for living, supplementary housing allowance (sometimes called “supplement for housing”), and extraordinary immediate assistance. In terms of the budget structure, a humanitarian benefit provided to citizens of Ukraine who were granted temporary protection has also been included in this system of benefits since 2022.

Benefits for people with disabilities that means mobility allowance and grant for special aid were introduced in 2012 by the Act No 329/2011 Sb, on Providing Benefits for People with Disabilities and Amendments of Related Acts, as subsequently amended. The Act No 108/2006 Sb, on Social Services (effective since 1 January 2007), introduced the care benefit. The entitled person for this benefit is a person who, due to long-term bad health, needs assistance of another natural person while taking care of themselves and providing for self-sufficiency within the extent as defined by law. The persons may, on the basis of their own free will, reimburse professional social services or use the benefit to cover essential expenses for providing care within their family.

Such a job seeking person (job applicant) is entitled to get an unemployment benefit who complied with prerequisites as defined by the Act No 435/2004 Sb, on Employment, as subsequently amended. An advance of maintenance payment is a benefit that is to financially support for a temporary period of time a dependent child in a situation when its parent shall pay maintenance as decided by court, yet he/she does not fulfil his/her maintenance obligation. For more information, see the Act No 588/2020 Sb. The benefit was introduced on 1 July 2021.

Data in the Tables 26-1 to 26-9 and 26-13 to 26-23 are taken from the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. Data in the Table 26-10 on new reported cases of incapacity for work due to disease or injury are ensured by the Czech Statistical Office in cooperation with the Czech Social Security Administration (CSSA). Data in the Tables 26-11 and 26-12 on terminated cases of incapacity for work are taken from the CSSA.

Notes on Tables
Table 26-1 Expenditure on social security benefits of the population
Respective benefits, allowances, and grants are given in detail breakdowns in following tables of this chapter and described in general in the methodological notes. Pension insurance benefits include advance payments for pensions to be paid at the beginning of the following calendar year. They, conversely, do not include advance payments for pensions paid from the previous calendar year. Benefits for people with disabilities were introduced in 2012 and replaced the then applied scheme of benefits for people with disabilities (motor vehicle operation allowance, grant for purchase, capital repair, and special modification of a motor vehicle, individual transport allowance, housing adaptation grant, etc.).

Tables 26-2 to 26-6 Pension insurance scheme, types of pensions
Tables give pensions provided according to the Act on Pension Insurance. The tables do not include data on armed forces of the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Ministry of Justice. Entitlement to a pension arises by compliance with prerequisites which are different for each respective type of pension.

– The full old-age pension may be received either once the age limit for retirement has been reached, then it is a regular old-age pension, or before the age limit for retirement has been reached as determined by law and then it is an early old-age pension (sometimes called “premature”). Entitlement to the full old-age pension as well as the early (premature) one is simultaneously conditioned by acquiring the necessary period of insurance. When retiring to the early (premature) old-age retirement the early pension is reduced in accordance with how much time remains to reaching the old-age retirement limit. When the required period of insurance for the full old-age pension has not been met, the insured person may, after having reached a determined shorter period of insurance and the higher age determined by law, be granted a proportional pension. From 1 January 2023, an increase in the old-age pension by the so-called child-raising bonus, CZK 500 per month for each child raised, was introduced. The parent who has been taking care of the child the most is entitled to the child-raising bonus;

– the disability pension is acquired by an insured person whose ability to work was reduced due to long-term bad health by at least 35% and who has not reached the age of 65 years or the old-age retirement limit, if it is higher. In order the disability pension may be granted the condition of the necessary period of insurance for the entitlement to a disability pension must be complied with as well unless it is disability due to an occupational injury, an occupational disease, or due to some of causes related to the national defence. At the age of 65 years, the entitlement to a disability pension is void and is converted into an old-age pension. Depending on the level of the reduction of the ability to work, the disability is broken down to the disability of the first degree (reduction by 35% to 49%), the disability of the second degree (reduction by 50% to 69%), and the disability of the third degree (reduction by 70% and more); the amount of the disability pension is also derived from that;

– a surviving wife / a surviving husband is entitled to the widow’s / widower’s pension on condition that the deceased persons was a recipient of an old-age pension or a disability pension, or by the day of his/her death had met prerequisites for entitlement to the disability pension or the old-age pension, or deceased due to an occupational injury (occupational disease). Unless special conditions for further payment of widow’s and widower’s pension are met, the entitlement to these types of pensions ceases to exist after the period of one year;

– entitlement to an orphan pension can only arise for a dependent child whose deceased parent (a person who took over the care of the child) was compliant with the duration of insurance condition established by law or was a recipient of the old-age pension or the disability pension or died due to an occupational injury (an occupational disease);

– the types of pensions given may be paid separately, then they are so-called single pensions. Widows’ and widowers’ pensions may be paid simultaneously with the old-age pension or the disability pension (combined pensions). If prerequisites for entitlement to a payment of a widow’s or a widower’s pension are complied with simultaneously then rules for concurrent pensions apply.

Table 26-3 Pension recipients by type of pension and sex
The table shows data on recipients of single old-age pensions and on recipients of old-age pensions simultaneously with widows’ or widowers’ pensions (combined pensions). The category of recipients of disability pensions includes both recipients of single disability pensions and recipients of combined disability and widows’ or widowers’ pensions. On the contrary, the category of recipients of widows’ and widowers’ pensions includes merely recipients of these types of pensions (single pensions) without any simultaneously paid old-age or disability pensions. The total number of pension recipients is the sum of the categories.

Table 26-4 Average monthly amount of single pensions paid in December of a given year
For all categories, the table shows only data on single pensions paid. Data on combined pensions, in which multiple types of pensions are paid simultaneously to the same recipient, are not given here.

Table 26-5 Pension recipients by monthly amount of pension paid
Pension recipients are given here according to the monthly amount of pension paid in December. The amounts solely concern single pensions paid in every category but the widows’ or widowers’ pensions. Combined pensions, as simultaneously paid multiple types of pensions, are only given for the widows’ or widowers’ pensions.

Table 26-6 New pensions granted – basic indicators by type of pension
The table does not include pensions paid abroad. The indicator of the average amount of new pensions granted solely includes single pensions. If the socially insured person has met prerequisites for the full old-age pension by reaching the age limit for retirement (retirement age), he/she may at the age limit for retirement receive a regular old-age pension or may by further performing of gainful activities, after he/she has met prerequisites for the entitlement to an old-age pension, increase percentage of the assessment of his/her old-age pension (deferred pension). Entitlement to a disability pension ceases to exist by reaching the age of 65 years and, at the same time, entitlement to the old-age pension arises (in the table it is referred to as an old-age pension after disability pension). In 2022, there was a significant increase in the number of newly granted old-age pensions with regards to an exceptional adjustment of pensions because of which it was worth it to take early old-age pensions. The high number of applications for old-age pensions (especially the early ones) in 2022 has thus “siphoned off” potential applicants for old-age pensions in the following year. Therefore, there is a significant drop in the number of newly granted old-age pensions in 2023.

Tables 26-7 to 26-9 Sickness insurance scheme
The indicator of the average number of the sickness insured shows the average number of persons who are sickness-insured under the Act on Sickness Insurance. Data given in the table solely include the so-called civilian sector, i.e. exclude members of the Police of the CR, the Fire and Rescue Service of the CR, the Czech Customs Administration of the CR, the Prison Service of the CR, the Security Information Service, the Office for Foreign Relations and Information, and professional soldiers.

Definition of respective types of sickness insurance benefits:
– the sickness benefit – employees or own-account workers are entitled to receive sickness benefits for a period defined by law, in case of the incapacity for work due to a disease or an injury found by a physician or if quarantine was imposed on them;
– the attendance allowance – it is paid to employees taking care of a sick household member or of a healthy child aged under 10 years (in cases when educational or children’s facilities are closed, if quarantine has been imposed on a child, or if a person regularly taking care of a child has fallen ill);
– the maternity benefit – since 2011, it has been paid starting on the day that the insured person has to determine in the period from the beginning of the eighth to the beginning of the sixth week prior to the anticipated delivery of a child. The benefit is paid for 28 weeks (for the insured who gave birth to two or more children in one delivery it is 37 weeks);
– the pregnancy and maternity compensation benefit – it is provided to female employees who had to be moved to another, less paid job due to the pregnancy (maternity or breastfeeding);
– the paternity benefit – the benefit was introduced on 1 February 2018; it is a benefit which the child’s father who cares for the child is entitled to on condition that he started his paternity leave within the period of six weeks since the child’s birthday. A child’s father is the person who is registered as the child’s father in the birth registry. Before 2022, the benefit was paid for one week, at the maximum; since the beginning of 2022, it is 2 weeks, at the maximum;
– the long-term attendance allowance – the benefit was introduced on 1 June 2018; it is a benefit which a person who provides a long-term care to another person is entitled to. The person who is provided with the care has health status, which got seriously worsened and required at least four-day (until the end of 2021 at least seven-day) hospitalisation in a hospital and on the day of their release it was confirmed the person would require all-day care for the next 30 days, at least. The benefit is not paid for the period when the person provided with the care was hospitalised again. The benefit is paid for 90 calendar days, at the maximum.

Table 26-10 Incapacity for work due to disease or injury – basic indicators
Data for years before 2012 are based on the processing of the CZSO’s statistical questionnaire; since 2012, the CZSO has obtained the data by processing of data from an administrative data source of the Information System of the Czech Social

[T]
In the average monthly amount of single pensions paid table for December, the data shows that the amounts concern only single pensions paid across all categories. Combined pensions, where multiple types of pensions are paid simultaneously to the same recipient, are not included in this data.

In the pension recipients by monthly amount of pension paid table for December, the amounts concern only single pensions paid in every category except for the widows’ or widowers’ pensions. Combined pensions are only reported for the widows’ or widowers’ pensions.

In the new pensions granted table, the average amount of new pensions granted does not include pensions paid abroad and solely includes single pensions. If a socially insured person has met the prerequisites for the full old-age pension by reaching the retirement age, they may receive a regular old-age pension or may increase the percentage of their old-age pension through further gainful activities, referred to as a deferred pension. The entitlement to a disability pension ceases at age 65, at which point entitlement to the old-age pension arises. In 2022, there was a significant increase in the number of newly granted old-age pensions due to an exceptional adjustment of pensions, making early old-age pensions more appealing. This led to a high number of applications for old-age pensions in 2022, which has resulted in a significant drop in the number of newly granted old-age pensions in 2023.

In the sickness insurance scheme tables, the average number of sickness insured persons shows the average number of individuals who are sickness-insured under the Act on Sickness Insurance, excluding members of the Police of the CR, the Fire and Rescue Service of the CR, the Czech Customs Administration of the CR, the Prison Service of the CR, the Security Information Service, the Office for Foreign Relations and Information, and professional soldiers.

The sickness benefit is defined as the entitlement for employees or own-account workers to receive sickness benefits for a legally defined period in case of incapacity for work due to disease or injury. The attendance allowance is paid to employees caring for a sick household member or a healthy child under 10 years old.

The Security Administration (CSSA) registers cases of temporary incapacity for work in Czechia, which were reported by a physician electronically by means of the application called in Czech “eNeschopenka” (until the end of 2019, they completed a printed form called “Decision on the temporary incapacity for work”). The statistics of temporary incapacity for work captures all diseases and injuries, which caused at least one-day long incapacity for work of the sickness insured persons. Administrative data in the Information System of the CSSA contain data reported for all employees of legal and natural persons and separately for the own-account workers (the self-employed) whose sickness insurance is, however, voluntary. Since 2012, data are not fully comparable with data for the previous years.

New notified cases of incapacity for work are registered based on the reported beginning of the incapacity for work (a sick leave) of the sickness-insured persons. Note: The number of new notified cases of temporary incapacity for work due to disease also includes incapacity for work due to quarantine or isolation. In January (as of 17 January) and February 2022, while testing employees for COVID-19, some workers were given a sickness certificate for quarantine or isolation in duplicate. In order to act expeditiously in dealing with them, both general practitioners and regional public health authorities were issuing sickness certificates. However, it is not possible to identify duplicate cases from the available source databases. This has an impact on the other indicators presented and derived from them (the number of calendar days of incapacity for work, the average percentage of temporary incapacity for work).

Calendar days of incapacity for work show the sum of calendar days in a given year, for which sickness-insured employees were incapacitated for work (on a sick leave; based on the reported beginning and end of their incapacity for work (sick leave)). The average duration of one case of incapacity for work – the indicator expresses how many calendar days of incapacity for work there are on average per one new notified case of incapacity for work. The average percentage of incapacity for work expresses how many of one hundred of the sickness insured are on average every day incapacitated for work due to disease or injury. It is calculated as a ratio of the number of calendar days of incapacity for work (multiplied by 100) and the average number of the sickness-insured persons, multiplied by the number of calendar days in the given period.

Occupational injuries are injuries that occurred to employees when they were fulfilling their work assignments or in direct connection with them and that were reported to the CSSA.

Tables 26-11 and 26-12 Terminated cases of incapacity for work

Data on terminated cases of the incapacity for work due to disease or injury (hereinafter only referred to as incapacity for work) are obtained from the Czech Social Security Administration (CSSA). Data are obtained from electronic reports from physicians by means of the application called in Czech “eNeschopenka”. Terminated cases of incapacity for work include all diseases and injuries, which caused at least one-day-long incapacity for work of the sickness-insured persons that was terminated in the given year. Thus, it does not include diseases and injuries at which incapacity for work extended into the following year.

Calendar days of incapacity for work are the sum of calendar days, for which sickness-insured employees were incapacitated for work (on a sick leave; based on the reported beginning and end of their incapacity for work (sick leave)). The average duration of one case of incapacity for work – the indicator expresses how many calendar days of incapacity for work there are on average per one terminated case of incapacity for work.

Metodické vysvětlivky
Údaje za divadla, muzea, galerie, památky, festivaly a knihovny (tabulky 27-1 až 27-11) jsou získávány z výstupů z rezortní statistické služby Ministerstva kultury, které zpracovává Národní informační a poradenské středisko pro kulturu (NIPOS). Data pocházejí ze sebraných údajů ročních statistických zjišťování KULT a zachycují stav ke konci roku (např. počet divadel, knihoven, galerií) nebo úhrn za celý rok (např. počet představení, návštěvníků, uspořádaných výstav). Údaje o periodickém a neperiodickém tisku (tabulky 27-12 a 27-13) jsou publikovány NIPOS na základě zaslaných povinných výtisků do Národní knihovny České republiky.

V údajích za „státní, krajské a městské“ instituce jsou zahrnuty kulturní organizace, jejichž zřizovatelem je stát prostřednictvím Ministerstva kultury nebo jiného ministerstva a územně samosprávné celky (kraje, města a obce). Do „ostatních“ kulturních organizací jsou zahrnuty jednotky zřizovatelů církví, spolků, obecně prospěšných společností a soukromých subjektů (podnikajících právnických a fyzických osob).

Přehled kulturních činností je doplněn také o ekonomické ukazatele. V rámci ekonomických ukazatelů jsou sledovány především příjmy a výdaje z konkrétní kulturní činnosti a průměrný evidenční počet zaměstnanců přepočtený na plné pracovní úvazky.

Údaje za audiovizuální a mediální oblast jsou v případě kin přebírány ze Státního fondu kinematografie (tabulky 27-14) a údaje o provozovatelích rozhlasového a televizního vysílání (tabulka 27-15 a 27-18) jsou získávány z Rady pro rozhlasové a televizní vysílání. Údaje o programové struktuře rozhlasového a televizního vysílání (tabulky 27-16, 27-17 a 27-19) zjišťuje ČSÚ statistickým výkazem KULT 6-01. Údaje v tabulkách 27-20 a 27-21 pocházejí z výstupů Mezinárodní federace hudebního průmyslu, nezávislé společnosti výkonných umělců a výrobců zvukových a zvukově-obrazových záznamů INTERGRAM a Ochranného svazu autorského pro práva k dílům hudebním (OSA).

Poznámky k tabulkám
Tab. 27-1 až 27-3 Divadla
Divadlem se rozumí subjekt (instituce či jedinec) provozující ve sledovaném roce pravidelně divadelní a taneční činnost na profesionální bázi. Nezapočítávají se divadla bez vlastní pravidelné produkce (tzv. stagiony), která zajišťují svůj provoz primárně hostováním jiných profesionálních divadelních a tanečních souborů. Stálá divadelní scéna je prostor (sál, budova či letní scéna) pro pravidelný provoz divadelní a taneční činnosti. Divadlo (subjekt) nemusí provozovat žádnou stálou divadelní scénu či může provozovat několik stálých divadelních scén současně. Prostory, které byly mimo provoz (např. z důvodu rekonstrukce), se nezapočítávají. Divadelní soubor je stálý kolektiv umělců, techniků a dalších pracovníků, kteří zajišťují kontinuitu divadelní a taneční činnosti daného divadla. Divadlo (subjekt) nemusí zřizovat žádný divadelní soubor či může zřizovat několik divadelních souborů současně. Obsazení (casting) jedné inscenace není chápáno jako zřízení stálého divadelního souboru. Údaje za počet představení a návštěvníků zahrnují představení českých souborů, která proběhla na území České republiky.

Tab. 27-4 až 27-6 Muzea a galerie
Předmětem statistického zjišťování jsou muzea, galerie a památníky v provozu. Památníkem se rozumí místnost nebo objekt, kde je instalovaná expozice (výstava) vztahující se k významné osobě, místu nebo činnosti. Základním znakem rozlišujícím expozici od výstavy je, že expozice nemá předem ohlášený termín ukončení, je tedy budována a zpřístupněna na dobu neurčitou. Pro muzea a památníky je v tabulkách používán souhrnný název muzea. Statisticky šetřeny jsou jen ty galerie (muzea výtvarných umění), jež vlastní sbírkové předměty, nikoliv galerie prodejní.

Tab. 27-7 až 27-9 Památkové objekty s kulturním využitím
Údaje se týkají památkových objektů zpřístupněných návštěvníkům za vstupné. Patří sem hrady, zámky, kláštery, kostely, zříceniny, mlýny, věže apod. Památkové objekty, které jsou ve správě muzea nebo galerie, sem řazeny nejsou.

Tab. 27-10 Festivaly
Prezentovány jsou údaje o uměleckých (divadelních, tanečních, hudebních, filmových a literárních) festivalech, které jsou pořádány každoročně bez ohledu na délku trvání, tradici či na míru profesionality vystupujících umělců.

Tab. 27-11 Veřejné knihovny
Data zahrnují veřejné knihovny v České republice. Jedná se o knihovny v přímém řízení Ministerstva kultury, krajské vědecké knihovny zřizované krajskými úřady a knihovny zřizované obcemi a městy.

Tabulka předkládá vybrané ukazatele Satelitního účtu kultury, který je sestavován v souladu s usnesením vlády ČR. Ukazatele jsou uvedeny podle sektorů (skupin oblastí).

Methodological notes
Data on theatres, museums, galleries, monuments, festivals, and libraries (Tables 27-1 to 27-11) are obtained from the outputs of the Ministry of Culture's (ministerstvo kultury) statistical service, which are processed by the National Information and Consulting Centre for Culture (NIPOS). The data come from data collected in the annual KULT statistical surveys and capture the situation as at the end of the year (e.g. the numbers of theatres, libraries, and galleries) or represent annual aggregates (e.g. the numbers of performances, visitors/attendance, exhibitions held). The data on periodicals and non-periodicals (Tables 27-12 and 27-13) are published by NIPOS on the basis of compulsory copies sent to the National Library of the Czech Republic (Národní knihovna České republiky). The data for “state, regional, and municipal” institutions include cultural organisations the founder of which is the state through the Ministry of Culture or another ministry and territorial self-governing units (Regions, towns/cities, and municipalities). The “other” cultural organisations include units founded by churches, associations, generally beneficial companies (public benefit societies / benevolent societies) and private entities (entrepreneurs (legal and natural persons)).
An overview of cultural activities is also supplemented by economic indicators. The economic indicators mainly include the revenue from and expenditure on a specific cultural activity and the average registered number of employees (as full-time equivalent).
Data on the audiovisual and the media sector regarding cinemas are obtained from the State Cinematography Fund (Tabulka 27-14) and data on operators of radio and television broadcasting (Tables 27-15 and 27-18) from the Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting (Rada pro rozhlasové a televizní vysílání). Data on the structure of programme schedule of radio and television broadcasting (Tables 27-16, 27-17, and 27-19) are ascertained by the CZSO using the KULT 6-01 statistical form (questionnaire). Data in Tables 27-20 and 27-21 are obtained from the outputs of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (Mezinárodní federace fonografického průmyslu), an independent association of performing artists and producers of phonograms (sound recordings) and audio-visual fixations (recordings) INTERGRAM, and from the OSA - Collective rights management society for musical works.
Notes on Tables
Tables 27-1 to 27-3 Theatres
A theatre is an entity (an institution or a person) that operated theatre and dancing activities in the reference year regularly, on a professional basis. Excluded are theatres that do not have their own regular production (i.e. without their own theatre company), which provide for their operation primarily by hosting other professional theatre and dancing companies. A permanent theatre venue refers to premises (a theatre hall, a building, a summer scene) for permanent operation of theatre and dancing activities. A theatre (an entity) does not need to operate any permanent theatre venue or it can operate several permanent theatre venues concurrently. Premises, which have been out of operation (e.g. due to reconstruction) are not included. A theatre company is a permanent group of artists, technicians, and other workers, who ensure continuity of theatre and dancing activities of a given theatre. A theatre (an entity) does not have to establish any theatre company or it can establish several theatre companies concurrently. Casting of a play is not understood as establishment of a permanent theatre company. Data on the number of performances and visitors include performances of Czech companies that took place in the Czech Republic.
Tables 27-4 to 27-6 Museums and galleries
Museums, galleries, and monuments, which are in operation, are subjects of a statistical survey. A monument refers to a room or to an installation, in which an exposition (exhibition) is installed, which is related to an important person, site, or an activity. The basic feature distinguishing an exposition from an exhibition is that an exposition does not have a pre-announced termination date, i.e. it is built and made accessible for an indefinite period of time. In the tables, both museums and monuments are called museums. Only galleries (museums of fine arts), which own exhibits or collection artefacts are subjects of a statistical survey; commercial galleries are not included.
Tables 27-7 to 27-9 Historical and other monuments used for cultural purposes
Data refer to historical and other monuments accessible to visitors for an admission fee. These monuments encompass castles, chateaux, convents, monasteries, churches, ruins, mills, towers, etc. Historical and other monuments that are administered by museums or galleries are not included.
Table 27-10 Festivals
The tables show data on art festivals (theatrical, dance, music, film, and literary ones) that are organised every year irrespective of their duration, tradition, or level of professionalism of performing artists.

In the public libraries table (Tabulka 27-11 Veřejné knihovny) for the Czech Republic, the data includes public libraries that are directly managed by the Ministry of Culture, regional research libraries established by regional authorities, and libraries established by municipalities and towns. A branch library is defined as a part of a library that is separated by its location; it serves as an organizational unit of the library and is managed directly by the library. For instance, the Municipal Library of Prague (Městská knihovna v Praze) has over 40 branches. These branches are included in the total number of branches of the library; however, as a library, it is counted only once.

In the selected indicators of the Satellite Account on Culture table (Tabulka 27-22 Vybrané ukazatele Satelitního účtu kultury), the indicators are compiled in accordance with a resolution of the Government of the Czech Republic. The indicators are categorized by cultural sector, which includes various groups of domains. The culture is broken down according to the definition within the EU project of the ESSnet Culture into sectors, which encompass the following domains:
- In the traditional and the arts sector, cultural heritage includes activities of libraries, archives, museums, and the operation of cultural monuments.
- The performing arts domain covers scenic arts and the operation of cultural establishments.
- The visual arts domain involves artistic creation and photographic activities.
- Cultural education is also included in this sector.
- Art crafts are recognized as part of this sector as well.
- The audiovisual and the media sector includes periodicals and non-periodicals, which cover the publishing of periodicals and books, activities of news agencies, translation and interpretation activities, and the retail sale of periodicals and books.
- The audiovisual and interactive media domain encompasses radio and television broadcasting, publishing of computer games, activities in the domain of music and film, and the retail sale of audio and video recordings.
- The creative sector includes architecture, advertising activities of advertising agencies, and specialized design services.
- Administrative and technical support activities to support culture are summarized in the table as "administrative activities to support culture," which includes activities performed by the Ministry of Culture and other institutions, as well as activities performed by civic associations and other organizations specializing in collective management of rights.

Informace o účasti a umístění českých reprezentantů v rámci olympijských her (tabulky 28-1 a 28-2) a o medailích českých reprezentantů na mistrovstvích světa a mistrovstvích Evropy (tabulky 28-4 a 28-5) poskytuje od roku 2022 Národní sportovní agentura. Údaje o výdajích státu na sport (tabulka 28-3) jsou získány ze závěrečných účtů státního rozpočtu ČR dostupných na internetových stránkách Ministerstva financí.
Údaje za osoby, které se organizovaně věnují vybraným sportům (tabulka 28-6), byly zpracovány z Ročenky České unie sportu (ČUS), a to z tabulky Členská základna evidovaná ve sportovních svazech sdružených v ČUS k 31. 12. 2023. Informační systém ČUS s údaji o členské základně sportovních klubů a tělovýchovných jednot evidovaných v okresních sdruženích ČUS byl využit pro zpracování údajů o dětech a mládeži organizovaně se věnující sportu (tabulka 28-7).
Poznámky k tabulkám
Tab. 28-3 Výdaje ze státního rozpočtu na sport
Celkové státní rozpočtové výdaje na sport vychází z údajů uvedených v závěrečném účtu státního rozpočtu ČR pro tuto oblast, tj. z tabulky Souhrn výdajů státního rozpočtu podle funkčního členění (pododdíl 341). Jedná se o výdaje, které byly ze státního rozpočtu v daném roce na sport opravdu čerpány, a nikoliv o částky schválené v zákoně o státním rozpočtu na daný rok. Údaje o výdajích na sportovní reprezentaci jsou součtem údajů za výdaje na sportovní reprezentaci Ministerstva obrany a Ministerstva vnitra a údajů o rozvoji a podpoře sportovní reprezentace financované z rozpočtové kapitoly Národní sportovní agentury a Ministerstva školství mládeže a tělovýchovy.

Zahrnuje členskou základnu evidovanou ve vybraných sportovních svazech k 31. 12. 2023 sdružených v ČUS, tj. sportovce, rozhodčí, trenéry a funkcionáře. V tabulce tak nejsou zahrnuty sportovní svazy, jako je např. Česká asociace Sport pro všechny nebo Česká asociace univerzitního sportu, jejichž členové mohou spadat do více kategorií sportu. Ne všechny sportovní svazy jsou také členy ČUS, jde například o Český svaz biatlonu nebo Český střelecký svaz.

Data on the participation and rankings of Czech sport representatives in the Olympic Games (Tables 28-1 and 28-2) and on medals won by Czech representatives at world championships and European championships (Tables 28-4 and 28-5) have been provided since 2022 by the National Sports Agency. Data on the state budget expenditure on sport (Table 28-3) have been obtained from the final account of the state budget of the Czech Republic available on the website of the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic.

Data on persons doing selected sports as members of sport unions and associations (Table 28-6) were processed from the Czech Union of Sport (CUS) Yearbook, namely from the table Membership base registered in sport unions and associations associated in the CUS as at 31 December 2023. The CUS information system with data on the membership base of sports clubs registered in district associations of the CUS was used to process data on children and youth doing sports in unions and associations (Table 28-7).

Notes on Tables
Table 28-3 State budget expenditure on sport
The total state budget expenditure on sport is based on data presented in the final account of the State Budget of the Czech Republic for that area, i.e. on a table Summary of the state budget expenditure by functional aspect (kind-of-activity budget classification; subsection 341). It is the expenditure that was actually drawn from the state budget for sport in a given year, not the amounts approved in the Act on the State Budget for that year. Data on the expenditure on sports representation are the sum of data on expenditure on sports representation by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior and data on the development and promotion (support) of sports representation financed from the budget chapter of the National Sports Agency and the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports.

Table 28-6 Persons doing selected sports as members of sport unions and associations
The table includes the number of members (membership base) registered in selected sport unions and associations as at 31 December 2023 associated in the CUS, i.e. athletes, judges (umpires), coaches, and officials. It does not include sport unions and associations (such as the Czech Association of Sport for All and the Czech Association of University Sport) members of which can belong to more than one category of sport. Not all sport unions and associations are also members of the CUS, e.g. the Czech Biathlon Union or the Czech Shooting Federation.

The table also indicates the medals won at the Summer Olympic Games (Medaile získané na letních olympijských hrách). In the Atlanta Olympics (1996), the Czech Republic won 7 medals, including gold, silver, and bronze. The medal counts for subsequent Olympics are as follows: Sydney (2000) had 6 medals, Athens (2004) had 5 medals, Beijing (2008) had 4 medals, London (2012) had 3 medals, Rio de Janeiro (2016) had 2 medals, and Tokyo (2020) had 1 medal. The upcoming Paris Olympics (2024) is anticipated to continue this tradition.

In 2023, the table regarding children and youth doing sports in unions and associations (Děti a mládež organizovaně se věnující sportu v roce 2023) indicates that for the age group of 6-17 years, the participation rate per 100 population in the district was categorized as follows: <= 19.9, 20.0–24.9, 25.0–29.9, 30.0–34.9, and >= 35.0.

Poznámky k tabulkám
Tab. 29-1 až 29-8 Kriminalita
Objasněnost – objasněné skutky jsou ty, u kterých byl zjištěn (a vykázán) alespoň jeden známý pachatel a zároveň je skutek ukončen v předmětném roce. Registrovaný skutek – vykázaný trestný čin, kdy bylo zahájeno trestní řízení ve sledovaném roce a je ukončeno (určitým způsobem) nebo neukončeno. Násilná kriminalita je řazena do obecné kriminality. Jde o pojem užívaný kriminologií, nikoliv pojem právní. Zahrnuje útok na fyzickou nebo psychickou integritu člověka, ve smyslu úmyslného užití fyzického násilí, resp. pohrůžky násilí, vůči jiné osobě. Mravnostní kriminalita je řazena do obecné kriminality. Tyto trestné činy zasahují důstojnost oběti v sexuální oblasti. Do této skupiny patří zejména trestné činy ohrožující svobodu rozhodování v oblasti pohlavního života, ohrožující zdravý mravní a tělesný vývoj dětí nebo ohrožující některé mravní zásady. Majetková kriminalita spočívá zejména v útoku na cizí majetek nejen fyzických, ale i právnických osob. Ostatní obecná kriminalita je nehomogenní skupinou trestných činů, bez jednotné definice. Spadá pod obecnou kriminalitu. Trestné činy v ní obsažené jsou pouze souhrnem skutků s různými určujícími znaky, např. výtržnictví, drogová trestná činnost, maření výkonu úředního rozhodnutí nebo ohrožování výchovy dítěte. Hospodářská kriminalita má blízkou souvislost s kriminalitou majetkovou, ale na rozdíl od majetkové kriminality, která útočí na majetek jiných osob, hospodářská kriminalita je jednání, které směřuje proti hospodářskému systému a jeho fungování. Spadají sem trestné činy z oblasti daní a poplatků, účetnictví, padělání peněz, korupce, ale také např. protiprávní jednání v oblasti životního prostředí. Zbývající kriminalita zahrnuje trestné činy, které nepatří do obecné kriminality, a ani do kriminality hospodářské či pod vojenské a protiústavní činy. Stejně jako ostatní obecná kriminalita je pouze souhrnem trestných činů bez společných určujících znaků. Např. ohrožení pod vlivem návykové látky, zanedbání povinné výživy nebo šíření poplašné zprávy. Vojenské a protiústavní činy spadají dle policejních statistik zejména do zvláštní části trestního zákoníku a zahrnují trestné činy jako je např. vlastizrada, teroristický útok, podpora a propagace terorismu či sabotáž. Údaje v tabulkách podle takticko-statistické klasifikace trestných činů používané Policií ČR. Kódy klasifikace se částečně překrývají s paragrafy trestního zákoníku.

Tab. 29-9 a 29-10 Stíhané a vyšetřované osoby
Počty osob, které jsou policií vyšetřovány pro podezření ze spáchání trestného činu, a následně je proti nim zahájeno trestní stíhání. Jedna osoba může být stíhána za více trestných činů souběžně, bude proto započítána do každé kategorie zvlášť. Proto součet za jednotlivé kategorie trestných činů bude vždy vyšší než za kriminalitu celkem. Jednotlivé řádky proto nelze sčítat.

Tab. 29-11 a 29-12 Oběti kriminality
Policie ČR statisticky neeviduje oběti trestné činnosti ve smyslu zákona č. 45/2013 Sb., o obětech trestných činů. Eviduje pouze objekty napadení, tj. zpravidla ty objekty, vůči kterým bezprostředně směřuje trestná činnost. Objekty napadení však nelze plně zaměňovat s oběťmi trestné činnosti. Je-li objektem napadení osoba, je (zpravidla) vždy i obětí, ale každá oběť trestného činu nemusí být objektem napadení (např. pozůstalá osoba po oběti, které byla trestným činem způsobena smrt).

Tab. 29-13 Soudní agendy u okresních a krajských soudů
Trestní agenda – rejstřík T + Tm – věci projednávané soudem na základě obžaloby či návrhu na potrestání podané státním zástupcem, v nichž je rozhodováno o vině, případně o trestní sankci a náhradě škody způsobené trestnou činností. Dále sem patří též případy rozhodování soudu o návrhu na schválení dohody o vině a trestu. Občanskoprávní agenda – rejstřík C – převážnou část agendy tvoří věci upravené zákonem č. 89/2012 Sb., občanský zákoník, ve znění pozdějších předpisů (dále jen „občanský zákoník“), který 1. ledna 2014 nahradil původní občanský zákoník (zákon č. 40/1964 Sb.) a zákon o rodině (zákon č. 94/1963 Sb.). Dále pak pracovní věci upravené zákoníkem práce (zákon č. 262/2006 Sb., ve znění pozdějších předpisů). Občanskoprávní agenda se řadí mezi civilní agendy soudů.

Kriminalita, soudnictví, nehody
Crime, justice, accidents

Věc – označení případu projednávaného soudem, který je zapsán v příslušném rejstříku pod spisovou značkou. U trestních agend je potřeba rozlišovat mezi počtem věcí a počtem osob, neboť jedno trestní řízení může být vedeno i proti více osobám.

Příchozí věci – součet obživlých a napadlých věcí.
Obživlé věci – jsou ty, u kterých v důsledku rozhodnutí soudu vyššího stupně musí následovat řízení před soudem prvního stupně po úplném nebo částečném zrušení rozhodnutí nebo po nevyhovění návrhu na změnu příslušnosti či odnětí a přikázání věci anebo dochází k novému projednání věci v důsledku povolení obnovy řízení nebo zrušení původního rozhodnutí pro zmatečnost anebo rozhodnutím Ústavního soudu.

Napadlé věci – jsou v trestních věcech počet podaných obžalob, návrhů na potrestání nebo návrhů na schválení dohody o vině a trestu. V občanskoprávní agendě a agendě P a Nc počet návrhů na zahájení řízení (žalob), které byly soudu doporučeny k projednání (včetně případů, kdy soud řízení zahájí bez návrhu z úřední povinnosti) a které soud zapíše do příslušného rejstříku.

Vyřízené věci – počet věcí, ve kterých soud nepravomocně rozhodl.
Nevyřízené věci – počet věcí, ve kterých soud dosud nerozhodl. Tento údaj se vztahuje vždy k 31. prosinci příslušného roku.

Tab. 29-14 Trestní agenda u okresních, krajských a vrchních soudů
Prvoinstanční agenda – také prvostupňová agenda. Soudní řízení bývá zpravidla dvoustupňové. Každá nová věc (spor nebo jiná právní věc) je nejdříve projednána a rozhodnuta v první instanci. Okresní soudy jsou soudy první instance vždy, není-li k tomu podle předpisů upravujících soudní řízení určen jiný článek soudní soustavy. Takovým jiným článkem jsou zpravidla krajské soudy. Existuje však velmi malý okruh věcí, kdy jako prvoinstanční soud působí soudy vrchní nebo nejvyšší (Nejvyšší soud a Nejvyšší správní soud).

Odvolací agenda – také druhostupňová agenda. Lze-li nepravomocné rozhodnutí soudu I. stupně napadnout opravným prostředkem, rozhoduje o něm bezprostředně nadřízený soud v odvolacím řízení. K okresnímu soudu jako soudu I. stupně je odvolacím soudem krajský soud a o odvolání proti rozhodnutí krajského soudu jako soudu prvostupňového rozhoduje vrchní soud. V trestní agendě se jedná o rejstříky označené jako To a Tmo.

Délka řízení – ode dne nápadu do dne vyřízení soudem I. stupně a u odvolacího soudu ode dne nápadu u tohoto soudu do jeho vyřízení; v trestní agendě pokud řízení končí u odvolacího soudu tak se stává věc pravomocnou. Délka řízení je vždy udávána v kalendářních dnech. Vypočtena je ze statistických listů poté, co byl proces řízení dokončen.

Míra odvolání – jedná se o poměr pravomocně vyřízených věcí, v nichž bylo podáno odvolání, k celkovému počtu pravomocně skončených (vyřízených) věcí.

Tab. 29-15 Trestně stíhané osoby skončené v přípravném řízení
Přípravné řízení – počet fyzických osob, vůči kterým bylo vedeno trestní stíhání zahájené sdělením obvinění podle § 160 trestního řádu a bylo ve sledovaném roce ukončeno.

Zkrácené přípravné řízení – počet fyzických osob, u nichž zkrácené přípravné řízení vedené podle § 179a a násl. trestního řádu bylo ve sledovaném roce ukončeno. Ve zkráceném přípravném řízení nedochází k zahájení trestního stíhání obviněného, ale vyhotovuje se záznam o sdělení podezření. Obviněný se nazývá po celou dobu podezřelý z trestného činu. Tento postup je však možný jen za určitých okolností a jen u některých méně závažných trestných činů, za které trestní zákoník stanoví trest odnětí svobody s horní hranicí nepřevyšující 5 let.

Obžalováno osob – počet fyzických osob, na něž byla podána obžaloba podle § 176 trestního řádu.

Podán návrh na schválení dohody o vině a trestu – počet fyzických osob, s nimiž státní zástupce v přípravném řízení dle § 175a trestního řádu nebo ve zkráceném přípravném řízení dle § 179b odst. 5 trestního řádu sjednal dohodu o vině a trestu a následně podal soudu návrh na schválení této dohody. Podstatou je, že obviněný prohlásí, že spáchal skutek, pro který je stíhán, a současně se ujedná výměra a druh trestu; její součástí může být ujednání o náhradě škody, nemajetkové újmy nebo vydání bezdůvodného obohacení. Od 1. října 2020 ji lze uzavřít i v případě zvlášť závažného zločinu (novela trestního řádu provedena zák. č. 333/2020 Sb.). Nelze ji však sjednat v řízení proti uprchlému či mladistvému, který nedovršil osmnáct let věku.

Trestní stíhání zastaveno – počet fyzických osob, u kterých došlo k zastavení trestního stíhání podle § 172 trestního řádu nebo podmíněnému zastavení trestního stíhání podle § 307 trestního řádu.

Trestní stíhání přerušeno – počet fyzických osob, u kterých došlo k přerušení trestního stíhání podle § 173 trestního řádu. Přerušení trestního řízení je rozhodnutím prozatímní povahy, věc není definitivně skončena.

Trestní stíhání postoupeno – počet věcí, které byly postoupeny jinému orgánu podle § 171 trestního řádu.

Návrh na potrestání – počet fyzických osob, na něž byl podán návrh na potrestání podle § 179c trestního řádu. Návrh na potrestání je obdobou obžaloby, ale neobsahuje odůvodnění a je obsahově stručnější.

Podmíněně odloženo – počet fyzických osob, u kterých místo podání návrhu na potrestání došlo k podmíněnému odložení návrhu na potrestání podle § 179g trestního řádu.

For example, if the perpetrator committed a crime in a state of diminished responsibility and the court orders protective treatment; if the person regrets the act and shows a genuine effort for correction, and mere discussion of the case suffices for correction. If the court waives punishment, the perpetrator is regarded as if they had not been convicted. The term "Upuštěno od uložení souhrnného nebo společného trestu (trestního opatření)" refers to the court waiving the imposition of a cumulative or joint penalty (criminal measure) if it deems that the penalty (criminal measure) imposed by a previous judgment is sufficient.

Tab. 29-23 Osoby ve výkonu trestu odnětí svobody
Recidivista je ten, kdo již alespoň jednou vykonával trest odnětí svobody.

Tab. 29-24 Osoby ve výkonu trestu odnětí svobody za vybrané trestné činy
Vykazované počty jsou četnostmi vybraných trestných činů (samostatně i v souběhu s jiným trestným činem) v aktuálně vykonávaných (k 31. 12. daného roku) trestech odnětí svobody. Tzn., že jedna osoba může být odsouzena k trestu odnětí svobody za více trestných činů souběžně, bude proto započítána do každé kategorie zvlášť. Proto součet za jednotlivé trestné činy bude vždy vyšší než za kriminalitu celkem. Jednotlivé řádky proto nelze sčítat! Údaje v tabulkách podle trestního zákoníku.

Tab. 29-25 Policisté, soudci a vězeňská stráž
Policisté – jsou zahrnuti pouze příslušníci Policie ČR (státní policie). Soudci – jsou zahrnuti pouze soudci na trestním úseku. Vězeňská stráž – jsou zahrnuti pouze příslušníci vězeňské služby, nejsou zahrnuti civilní zaměstnanci.

Tab. 29-26 až 29-29 Dopravní nehody
Nehody v železniční dopravě – uvedeny pouze vážné nehody, nejsou zahrnuty sebevraždy a pokusy o sebevraždu. Nehody v silniční dopravě celkem – uvedeny všechny nehody v silničním provozu, které byly dopravní policii nahlášeny. Účastník dopravní nehody je povinen nehodu nahlásit dopravní policii, dojde-li ke zranění nebo usmrcení, nebo ke škodě na majetku třetí osoby, nebo při škodě na některém z vozidel (včetně nákladu) převyšující částku 100 000 Kč. Údaje o nehodách v letecké dopravě jsou za všeobecné letectví. Za usmrcenou osobu se považuje osoba, která zemřela na místě nehody, při převozu do nemocnice nebo nejpozději do 30 dnů. (Tyto údaje jsou v souladu s doporučením Evropské hospodářské komise OSN a jsou vykazovány ve většině zemí EU.) Těžké zranění, lehké zranění – klasifikaci těžkého a lehkého zranění určuje lékař.

Tab. 29-30 Mimořádné události se zásahy jednotek požární ochrany (JPO)
Požár – každé nežádoucí hoření, při kterém došlo k usmrcení či zranění osob nebo zvířat anebo ke škodám na materiálních hodnotách nebo životním prostředí. Za požár se považuje i nežádoucí hoření, při kterém byly osoby, zvířata, materiální hodnoty nebo životní prostředí bezprostředně ohroženy. Dopravní nehoda – mimořádná událost související s provozem dopravního prostředku v pohybu, při níž došlo k usmrcení nebo zranění osoby nebo ke škodě na majetku. Za dopravní nehodu je třeba považovat i případ, kdy JPO odstraňovaly pouze drobné následky nehody (očištění komunikace nebo odstranění úniků látek – provozních náplní vozidel apod.), pokud to byl následek dopravní nehody. Dopravní nehody se zatřídí podle převažujícího charakteru nehody. Pokud by v činnosti JPO převládaly jiné práce, např. z důvodu úniku nebezpečné látky do životního prostředí, klasifikuje se tento zásah podle převažujícího charakteru. Dopravní nehoda s následným požárem patří vždy do kategorie požár. Únik nebezpečné chemické látky – zásah u události spojený s nežádoucím uvolněním nebezpečných chemických látek včetně ropných produktů (během výroby, dopravy nebo manipulace) a ostatních látek (nebezpečné látky jsou definovány zákonem). Únik se klasifikuje podle skupenství. Zásah k omezení nebo snížení rizika nekontrolovaného úniku hořlavých, výbušných, žíravých, jedovatých, zdraví škodlivých, radioaktivních a jiných nebezpečných látek, ropných produktů případně ostatních látek do životního prostředí (zemní plyn, kyseliny a jejich soli, louhy, čpavek apod.) včetně závažných havárií dle § 2 písm. g zákona o prevenci závažných havárií. Únik ropného produktu (olejová havárie) – zásah převážně k zabránění úniku a omezení jeho rozsahu výhradně ropných produktů. Jde výhradně o únik ropných produktů (benzinů, nafty nebo oleje). Úniky těchto látek z provozních náplní vozidel následkem dopravní nehody jsou klasifikovány jako dopravní nehoda. Technické havárie celkem – zásah u mimořádné události vedoucí k odstranění nebezpečí nebo nebezpečných stavů. Technická havárie – odstranění nebezpečí nebo nebezpečných stavů velkého rozsahu či značných následků na zdraví osob, zvířat či majetku (např. destrukce objektu). Technická pomoc – odstranění nebezpečí nebo nebezpečných stavů mimo technologický provoz závodů (mimo dopravních nehod). Jedná se o pomoc technikou JPO bez návaznosti na jakýkoliv technologický provoz resp. výrobu (např. vyproštění osob či předmětů, nouzové otevření, otevírání uzamčených prostorů, záchrana osob a zvířat; čerpání, uzavírání a navážení vody, provizorní nebo jiné opravy apod.).

Technologická pomoc – odstranění nebezpečí nebo nebezpečných stavů zejména v technologii či provozu. Jedná se o pomoc technikou JPO (např. nouzová dodávka vzduchu, vody, elektřiny; požární asistence, následné dohašování ohnisek požáru lesa apod.).

Ostatní pomoc – nelze klasifikovat předchozími druhy technické havárie. Jedná se např. o snášení, odvoz nebo převoz pacienta, pátrání po pohřešovaných osobách, monitoring (např. vodních toků, používaných norných stěn), kontrola průjezdnosti komunikací apod., pomoci na vyžádání jiného subjektu (přímo i nepřímo poskytnutá pomoc).

Radiační nehoda – zásah u mimořádné události spojený s nepřípustným uvolněním radioaktivních látek nebo ionizujícího záření.

Ostatní mimořádné události – zásah u jiné mimořádné události např. epidemie nebo nákazy způsobené nebezpečnou nemocí, zajištění podezřelých zásilek a dále pak všechny zásahy u událostí, které nelze klasifikovat předchozími kategoriemi.

Tab. 29-31 Zásahy jednotek požární ochrany (JPO) při živelních pohromách
Živelní pohroma – mimořádná událost, k níž došlo následkem škodlivě působících sil a jevů vyvolaných plošně či lokálně přírodními vlivy, které ohrožují životy, zdraví, majetek nebo životní prostředí jako například povodně, záplavy, deště, vliv sněhu a námrazy, větrné smrště, sesuvy půdy a zemětřesení. Živelní pohromy se evidují pomocí příznaku vždy ve spojení s druhem likvidované události.

Tab. 29-32 Základní ekonomické ukazatele Hasičského záchranného sboru ČR
HZS ČR – Hasičský záchranný sbor České republiky; tvoří ho generální ředitelství HZS ČR (které je součástí Ministerstva vnitra) a hasičské záchranné sbory krajů. JPO II, JPO III, JPO V – kategorie JPO podle zákona o požární ochraně; jde o jednotky sboru dobrovolných hasičů obce, jejichž členové vykonávají službu v jednotce jako svoje zaměstnání nebo dobrovolně s územní působností mimo katastrální území zřizovatele, zpravidla do 10 minut jízdy z místa dislokace (JPO II a JPO III) a jednotky, jejichž členové vykonávají službu v jednotce dobrovolně s místní působností na katastrálním území zřizovatele (JPO V).

Tab. 29-33 až 29-36 Požáry
Usmrcené osoby celkem – všechny usmrcené osoby nalezené na místě požáru. Údaj zahrnuje i osoby, jejichž smrt prokazatelně nenastala v přímé souvislosti s požárem např. v důsledku infarktu, vraždy apod. Usmrcené osoby v přímé souvislosti – osoby, které zemřely v důsledku popálenin, intoxikace zplodinami hoření apod., tak osoby, u kterých nebylo možné zjistit, zda prokazatelně zemřely v přímé souvislosti s požárem.

Methodological notes
This chapter was prepared using information provided by the Ministry of Justice, the General Directorate of the Prison Service of the CR, the Police Presidium of the CR, the Ministry of Transport, and the Ministry of the Interior – General Directorate of the Fire and Rescue Service of the CR. The change in the territorial administrative structure of the Czech Republic effective as of 1 January 2000 is not reflected in the organisational structure of justice and prison service.

Notes on Tables
Tables 29-1 to 29-8 Crime
The clearance rate – solved offences are those for which at least one known offender has been identified (and reported) and the offence is terminated in the reference year. Registered offence – reported criminal offence, where criminal prosecution initiated was conducted and terminated in the reference period or is still pending. Violent crime is included in general crime. It is a term used by criminology, not a legal concept (term). It includes an attack on the physical or mental integrity of a person, in the sense of an intentional use of physical violence, or the threat of violence, against another person. Sexual crime is included in general crime. These criminal offences affect the dignity of a victim in the sexual sphere. This group includes, in particular, criminal offences that threaten freedom of sexual decision-making, threaten the healthy moral and physical development of children, or threaten certain moral principles. Property crime mainly consists in an attack on somebody else's property, not only of natural persons but also legal entities. Other general crime is a non-homogeneous group of crimes / (criminal) offences, without a uniform definition. It falls under general crime. The crimes / (criminal) offences included in it are only a collection of offences with various defining characteristics, e.g. disorderly conduct; drug-related crime; obstruction of justice; or endangering a child’s care. Economic crime is closely related to property crime, but unlike property crime, which attacks the property of other persons, economic crime is an act that is directed against the economic system and its functioning. This includes tax and fiscal offences, false accounting, forgery and alteration of money, corruption, but also, for example, acts against the natural environment (environmental crimes). The remaining crime includes crimes / (criminal) offences that do not fall under general crime, nor under economic crime or under military and unconstitutional acts. Like the other general crime, it is only a collection of crimes / (criminal) offences without common defining characteristics, for example, menace under influence of addictive substance, negligence of mandatory support, or spreading of alarming news. Military and unconstitutional acts (military criminal offences and offences against the constitutional system) – according to police statistics, they fall mainly under a special part of the Criminal Code and include crimes / (criminal) offences such as treason, terrorist attack, support and promotion of terrorism, or sabotage. Data in tables are according to the Tactical-statistical classification (of crimes) used by the Police of the Czech Republic. Codes in the classification partially overlaps with paragraphs of the Criminal Code.

Tables 29-9 and 29-10 Prosecuted and investigated persons
Number of people who are investigated by the police on suspicion of committing a crime / (criminal) offence and criminal prosecutions are subsequently brought against them. One person may be prosecuted and investigated for several offences at the same time and will therefore be counted separately in each category. Therefore, the total for individual categories will always be higher than the total for all crime. The individual lines thus cannot be added together!

Tables 29-11 and 29-12 Victims of crime
The Police of the Czech Republic does not keep statistical records of victims of crime within the intention of the Act No 45/2013 Sb, on Victims of Criminal Offences. It only registers objects of an attack, i.e., as a rule, those objects against whom the criminal activity is directly directed. However, objects of an attack cannot be fully interchanged with victims of crime / criminal activity. If an attacked person is the object, he or she is (as a rule) always a victim, too, but not every victim of a crime / (criminal) offence is an object of an attack (e.g. a survivor of a victim who has been killed by a crime / (criminal) offence).

Table 29-13 Cases handled by district and regional courts
Criminal cases – T + Tm Registers – cases heard by a court based on charges brought or motions for punishment filed by the public prosecutor, in which guilt is decided or, as the case may be, penal sanctions and indemnities caused by criminal.

ICm Register – a register incorporating incidental disputes pursuant to the Insolvency Act and actions for nullity of cases kept in the INS Register.

A case – a case being heard by a court, which is entered (incorporated) in the relevant register under the file number. For criminal cases, it is necessary to distinguish between the number of cases and the number of persons, because one criminal proceeding may be conducted even against several persons.

Incoming cases – the sum of restored and filed cases.

Restored cases – are those cases, in which as a consequence of a decision of the court of higher instance, proceedings in the court of first instance have to follow after full or partial reversal of a decision or after rejection of a motion for a change of jurisdiction or for removal or referral of a case, or there is a new hearing of the case as a result of the granting of a retrial or the annulment of the original decision on the grounds of confusion (nullity) or by a decision of the Constitutional Court.

Filed cases – in criminal cases: the number of filed charges, motions for sentence, and petitions for approving an agreement on the guilt and punishment. In civil cases and in P and Nc cases: the number of motions for commencement of proceedings (actions), which were recommended to the court for hearing (including cases, in which the court initiates proceedings without a motion, because it is its official duty) and that are incorporated in an appropriate register by the court.

Resolved cases – the number of cases decided by courts (decisions are not effective).

Pending cases – the number of cases not yet decided by courts. This piece of data always refers to 31 December of the relevant year.

Table 29-14 Criminal cases handled by district, regional, and high courts

First instance cases – also first instance agenda. Court proceedings usually have two instances (two tiers). Every new case (a dispute or another legal matter) is first heard and decided in the first instance. District courts are always courts of first instance unless another part of the court system is designated to do so under the rules governing court proceedings. Regional courts are usually such another part. However, there is a very small range of cases where the high or supreme courts (the Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court) act as the court of first instance.

Second instance cases – also second instance agenda (appellate agenda). If a non-final decision of the first instance court can be appealed, the immediate superior court decides on the appeal in appeal proceedings. A regional court is the court of appeal for a district court as the court of first instance; an appeal against a decision of a regional court as the court of first instance is decided by a high court. Regarding criminal cases, these are the registers marked as To and Tmo.

Length of proceedings – from the date of filing of a case to the date when the case is resolved by the court of first instance and in the case of a court of appeal from the date of filing of a case in that court to the date when the case is resolved by that court. In criminal cases, when the proceedings are ended by a court of appeal, the case becomes final. The length of proceedings is always given in calendar days. It is calculated from statistical criminal reports after the trial has been completed.

Appeal ratio – it is the ratio of the number of finally resolved cases in which an appeal has been filed to the number of finally completed (resolved) cases.

Table 29-15 Persons prosecuted (terminated) in pre-trial proceedings

Pre-trial proceedings – the number of natural persons against whom a criminal prosecution initiated by notification of accusation under the Section 160 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was conducted and terminated in the reference year.

Summary pre-trial proceedings – the number of natural persons for whom summary pre-trial proceedings conducted under the Section 179(a) et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure were terminated in the reference year. In summary pre-trial proceedings, criminal prosecution of the accused is not initiated, but a record of a communication of suspicion is made. The accused is referred to as a suspect (of a crime / (criminal) offence) throughout the whole proceeding. However, this procedure is only possible in certain circumstances and only for certain minor offences for which the Criminal Code provides for a maximum penalty of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years.

Persons charged – the number of natural persons against whom a criminal charge was brought under the Section 176 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Crime, justice, accidents

Submitting a petition for approving an agreement on the guilt and punishment – the number of natural persons with whom a public prosecutor in pre-trial proceedings made an agreement on the guilt and punishment and then submitted to the court a petition for approving that agreement pursuant to the Sections 175(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure or in summary pre-trial proceedings pursuant to the Section 179(b) paragraph 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The crux is that the accused declares that he has committed the offence (act) for which he or she is being prosecuted and at the same time the type and level of the sentence are agreed; it may include an agreement on compensation for damages, non-pecuniary damage, or the release (surrender) of unjust enrichment. From 1 October 2020, it may also be concluded in the case of an extremely serious offence (amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure implemented by the Act No 333/2020 Sb). However, it cannot be concluded in proceedings against a fugitive or a juvenile under the age of 18.

A prosecution discontinued – the number of natural persons against whom prosecution was discontinued under the Section 172 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or conditionally discontinued under the Section 307 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

A prosecution suspended – the number of natural persons against whom prosecution was interrupted under the Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Prosecution interruption is an interlocutory decision; the case is not finally terminated.

A prosecution transferred – the number of cases referred to another authority under the Section 171 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

A motion for punishment – the number of natural persons against whom a motion for punishment was made under the Section 179(c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The motion for punishment is similar to a charge, but it does not contain reasoning and is more concise in content.

Conditionally suspended – the number of natural persons for whom, instead of submitting a motion for punishment, the motion for punishment was conditionally suspended pursuant to the Section 179(g) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Suspended – the number of cases in which the case was suspended within the framework of summary pre-trial proceedings for reasons pursuant to the Section 159(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Table 29-16 Persons convicted and acquitted in trial proceedings
A convicted person – a natural person against whom a judgement of conviction (even for a single crime / (criminal) offence) has been issued by a court and has become final (has already come into force); it also includes cases of conviction by final criminal order.

Acquitted – a natural person who has not been convicted of any crime by a court and has been acquitted of at least one crime.

Table 29-17 Convicted persons by type of sentence
A convicted person – a natural person against whom a judgement of conviction (even for a single crime / (criminal) offence) has been issued by a court and has become final (has already come into force); it also includes cases of conviction by final criminal order.

An imprisonment – a sentence served in prisons run by the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.

A probation order with supervision – sentence execution is conditionally suspended (by a court) over a probationary period and the offender is under supervision.

Sentence combined with other sentences – imposition of multiple sentences concurrently on a convicted natural person within the intention of the Section 53 of the Criminal Code.

A prohibition of activity – a sentence that consists in a prohibition of exercising a certain occupation, profession, function, or activity for 1 to 10 years.

Other sentence – e.g. deprivation of titles of honour and awards, loss of military rank, forfeiture of property, forfeiture of a thing, banishment, prohibition of residence, etc.

A punitive measure – unlike the provisions of the old Criminal Code or the new one for adult offenders, sanctions for criminal offences committed by juveniles are not called sentence but punitive measures under the Act No 218/2003 Sb, on Liability of Juveniles for Illegal Acts and on Juvenile Courts and amending certain acts (the Act on Juvenile Courts), as subsequently amended.

An absolute discharge – a waiver of punishment (a convict is discharged without punishment) under the Sections 46, 47, 48 of the Criminal Code and in the case of juveniles, a waiver of the imposition of a punitive measure and conditional waiver of the imposition of a punitive measure pursuant to the Sections 11, 12, 14 when several conditions are met. For example, an offender has committed the offence in a state of diminished sanity and the court orders protective medical treatment; the person regrets committing the offence and shows an effective desire for reformation (correction) and a mere hearing of the case is sufficient for reformation (correction). If the court waives punishment, the offender shall be treated as if he or she had not been convicted (sentenced).
[/X]

[T]
In the table titled "Persons convicted and acquitted in trial proceedings," a convicted person is defined as a natural person against whom a judgement of conviction has been issued by a court and has become final. This includes cases of conviction by final criminal order.

In the same table, an acquitted person is defined as a natural person who has not been convicted of any crime by a court and has been acquitted of at least one crime.

In the table titled "Convicted persons by type of sentence," a convicted person is again defined as a natural person against whom a judgement of conviction has been issued by a court and has become final, including cases of conviction by final criminal order.

In this table, an imprisonment refers to a sentence served in prisons run by the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.

A probation order with supervision indicates that the sentence execution is conditionally suspended over a probationary period, during which the offender is under supervision.

The term "sentence combined with other sentences" refers to the imposition of multiple sentences concurrently on a convicted natural person, as per the intention of Section 53 of the Criminal Code.

A prohibition of activity is a sentence that prohibits the exercise of a certain occupation, profession, function, or activity for a duration of 1 to 10 years.

The category "other sentence" includes various penalties such as deprivation of titles of honour and awards, loss of military rank, forfeiture of property, forfeiture of a thing, banishment, and prohibition of residence.

A punitive measure, as defined under the Act No 218/2003 Sb, refers to sanctions for criminal offences committed by juveniles, which are not termed as sentences but as punitive measures.

An absolute discharge is a waiver of punishment, meaning a convict is discharged without punishment under Sections 46, 47, 48 of the Criminal Code. In juvenile cases, this includes a waiver of the imposition of a punitive measure under specific conditions.
[/T][P][X]

Imposition of a summary or joint sentence (a punitive measure) is waived – the court shall waive the imposition of a summary or joint sentence (a punitive measure) if it considers that the sentence (punitive measure) imposed by the earlier judgement is sufficient.

Tables 29-18 and 29-19 Persons convicted of selected criminal offences. Data in tables are according to the Criminal Code (the new one or the old one). Only natural persons are included.

Table 29-20 Prisoners in Czechia. Prisoners are the total number of persons placed in prisons in the Czech Republic; it is a sum of accused persons (in custody), convicted persons (serving a sentence of imprisonment), and inmates in detention centres.

Custody is one of the security institutions by which the accused is secured for criminal proceedings and execution of sentence on the basis of a court decision. It is an institution of temporary deprivation of personal liberty, which prevents the accused from evading criminal prosecution, continuing criminal activity, or obstructing the discovery of facts relevant to the criminal prosecution. Custody is served in remand prisons or in special wards of prisons.

Security detention is a means of protecting society by isolating particularly dangerous offenders of crimes / (criminal) offences and of acts otherwise criminal, while simultaneously affecting these persons therapeutically and in an educational way.

Serving of a sentence of imprisonment is, unlike a custody, a criminal sanction, the aim of which is to punish the convicted person and prevent him or her from committing further crimes and to educate him or her systematically to lead a proper life.

Table 29-22 Convicts who commenced the sentence of imprisonment. Commencements of the sentence of imprisonment include commencements from civil life, committals of a convict to prison by the police, returns after prison breaks, returns after interruptions of the service of imprisonment pursuant to the Section 325 par. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or a takeover from abroad.

Tables 29-23 Convicts serving a sentence of imprisonment. A recidivist is the one who has already served at least one prison sentence before.

Tables 29-24 Persons serving a sentence of imprisonment for selected offences. Reported numbers are frequencies of selected offences (alone and in combination with another offence) in sentences of imprisonment currently being served (as at 31 December of a given year). It means that one person may be sentenced to imprisonment for several offences at the same time and will therefore be counted separately in each category. Therefore, the total for individual offences will always be higher than the total for all crime. The individual lines thus cannot be added together! Data in tables are according to the Criminal Code.

Tables 29-25 Police, court, and prison personnel. Police officers – only members of the Police of the Czech Republic (state police) are included. Judges – only criminal judges are included. Prison guard – only members of prison guards are included; civilian employees are not included.

Tables 29-26 to 29-29 Traffic accidents. Rail accidents – only serious accidents are shown, excluding suicides and attempted suicides. Road accidents, total – all road accidents reported to the Traffic Police. A person involved in a traffic accident is obliged to report the accident to the Traffic Police in case of an injury or a death or in case of a damage to a third party’s property or a material damage to any of the vehicles (including the load) exceeding CZK 100 000. Air accidents – data on air accidents are for general aviation only. A killed person – a person who died on the scene of the accident, during the transport to a hospital or due to a road accident if death occurs within 30 days of the accident. (The data comply with the recommendation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe; they are reported in most of the EU Member States). A serious injury, a slight injury – as classified by a medical doctor.

Tables 29-30 Emergencies with interventions of fire units
A fire – any undesirable combustion, in which people or animals were killed or injured or in which property or the environment were damaged. A fire is also any undesirable combustion, which poses an imminent threat to human or animal life, property or the environment.

A traffic accident – an emergency related to an operation of a vehicle in motion, in which a person was killed or injured or there was some property damage. A case, in which fire units removed only small consequences of an accident (cleaning of a road or removal of leakages of substances – fuels, lubricants, coolants and the like) shall also be considered a traffic accident provided that it was a consequence of a traffic accident. Traffic accidents are classified by prevailing character of an accident. Provided that other works prevail in activities of fire units, e.g. due to a leakage of a hazardous substance to the environment, the intervention is classified according to its prevailing character. A traffic accident with a consequent fire always belongs to the fire category.

Leakages of hazardous chemical substances – an intervention at an emergency connected with an undesirable leakage of hazardous chemical substances, including crude oil products (during production, transport or handling), and of other substances (hazardous substances are defined by law). Leakages are classified by the state of matter. An emergency to reduce or decrease the risk of uncontrollable leakage of flammable, explosive, corrosive, poisonous, harmful to health, radioactive, and other hazardous substances, crude oil products or other substances to the environment (natural gas, acids and acid salts, lye, ammoniac, etc.) including serious accidents pursuant to the Section 2(g) of an act on prevention of serious accidents.

Leakages of crude oil products (oil accident) – an intervention especially to prevent a leakage and reduce its extent of exclusively crude oil products. It applies exclusively to leakages of crude oil products (petrol, diesel or lubricating oils). Leakages of these substances (fuels, lubricants, coolants and the like) from vehicles as a consequence of traffic accidents are classified as a traffic accident.

Technical emergencies, total – interventions at emergencies resulting in removals of dangers or hazardous conditions. A technical emergency – a removal of dangers or hazardous conditions of a large scale or with enormous consequences for health of persons, animals or property (e.g. a building collapse). A technical assistance – a removal of dangers or hazardous conditions out of technological operation of plants (excluding traffic accidents). It applies to assistance with equipment of fire units without connection to any technological operation or manufacture (e.g. extrication of persons or objects, emergency opening, unlocking of locked premises, rescue of persons and animals; drawing, closing, and delivering of water, temporary or other repairs, and the like). A technological assistance – a removal of dangers or hazardous conditions especially in technologies or operations. It applies to assistance with equipment of fire units (e.g. emergency supply of air, water, electricity; fire assistance, subsequent final suppression and extinction of centres of a forest fire, and the like). Other assistance – it cannot be classified to the previous categories of technical emergencies. It applies e.g. to taking down, transportation or pick-up of a patient, searching for missing persons, monitoring (e.g. of watercourses, of used scum baffles), control of traffic capacity of roads, and the like, assistances upon request of another entity (directly or indirectly provided assistance).

A radiation accident and a radiological emergency – an intervention at an emergency connected with an impermissible release of radioactive substances or ionizing radiation. Other emergencies – an intervention at an emergency of another type, e.g. an epidemic or an infection caused by a dangerous disease, interception of suspect consignments, and furthermore all interventions at emergencies, which cannot be classified to any of the previous categories.

Table 29-31 Interventions of fire units at natural disasters
A natural disaster – a large-scale emergency caused by natural influences in a global or local manner that jeopardise lives, health, property or the environment e.g. floods, spates, heavy rains, influence of snow, frost, windstorms, landslides, and earthquakes. Natural disasters are registered by means of an attribute always in connection with the type of the emergency the consequences of which were eliminated.
